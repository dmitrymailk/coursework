Adding a “Split the Bill” Feature to Lieferando,"Imagine yourself on the sofa, your best friend to your right, your half-finished glass of wine to your left. It's late, it's Netflix time o'clock, and you are starving. What better moment to order a good old Pizza Margherita online. You're ordering two pizzas and your friend's also wants a starter on top — both of you don't have cash, so you pay the whole thing via Paypal and your friend tells you he's paying you back asap. You're a bit short on money these days, so you reluctantly give him a nod. You know your friend — he will forget and you will have to run after your money. Meh.Anyone who can relate? Well, then this one might be interesting for you.For my latest project at my Ironhack UX/UI Design bootcamp I had the task to add a feature to the current Lieferando mobile app, that allows users to split the bill at the end of the checkout process. Boom, challenge accepted.As with every design thinking process, I started with looking into the business, the market, the competitors, and the users.Lieferando is the biggest food delivery platform in Germany, and therefore market leader. The company was founded in 2009 in Berlin and in 2014 it was bought by Dutch company Takeaway.com. In the last few years some other companies joined the food delivery race, including Delivery Hero and Deliveroo… well, Delivery Hero was bought by Lieferando in 2019 and Deliveroo left the German market. So precisely, direct competition is non-existent.Lieferando cooperates with restaurants around German cities and acts as mediator between user and restaurant — with their own drivers. At this point more than 10000 businesses signed up on Lieferando and the company has more than half a million orders a month within Europe. Nomnomnom…To understand the user of Lieferando better, I did desk research as well as user interviews with people that are using the Lieferando app frequently. Some of my main findings during this research are:Based on my user interviews I discovered three main painpoints, which I summarised in the form of Jobs to be Done:It was quite interesting to see that users would really like to have an option to split the bill, but they would not like to delay the checkout process for example by having to type in various payment details, or waiting for others to authorise the payment before the order could go through.To empathise even more with the users and their frustrations, I created a persona:Now, based on all my research findings, my problem statement and approach to a solution could be summarised in the following way:The feature solution described above involved the integration in the app in various places. During the checkout process, users have to select their payment method. At this point it makes sense to let the user opt for splitting the costs. In addition to that the account menu should have a new page listing contacts, so users can start saving contacts that they repeatedly order food with. This will speed up the checkout process even more. When a payment request is sent to a user this will happen directly via Paypal, but also within the Lieferando app — that's where the Inbox is coming into the game.I have indicated the above mentioned pages in the current sitemap (in orange). To start with, I have focused on the placement within the order process. The placement within the inbox and the development of a contact section would be added in future iterations.Keeping the current checkout flow in mind, I have developed a user flow that demonstrates how the new feature fits into the mobile app.The user flow starts on the home screen, which is simultaneously the list of available restaurants, and ends with the order confirmation after a successful checkout. The new feature is coming into action after the appearance of the ""Your Order"" page, when the user decides to split the bill, who to split it with and how to split it. Here he or she has two options — to split it equally or to select items per person. By confirming the order and receiving the order confirmation, a Paypal payment request is sent to the email (and/or saved contact) indicated in this process.After drawing some basic low-fi paper wireframes and testing them with a couple of users, I came up with my first prototype based on mid-fi wireframes.I did some usability testing with the mid-fi prototype and with the results I was able to build my high-fis. One of the major feedback I received from users was that when asked whether to split the costs an explanation would be needed about how this would work. Thus I added a little explanation blurb.Another iteration entailed the visibility of an inactive and active button at the ""Select items per person"" screen as well as a note that all items have to be selected before the selection could be finished.This left me with my final prototype, which you can watch below:This was a four day project, so obviously, the points on my ""What's next"" list is endless. To break it down, the most important next steps for me would be:I must say this project was so much fun and so insightful as it was so close to a ""real-life"" case. Definitely going to look into more opportunities to develop new feature ideas for other widely used apps. But first… I'll order a pizza!"
Master the French Omelet the Julia Child Way,"This time last year, we were making omelets in Julia Child's kitchen.""Swirl, jerk, flip!"" we chanted the three steps of Child's 20-second omelet technique, inhaling the aroma of melting butter in the kitchen of the cook's former Provençal vacation home.""It's ready. Flip!"" our instructor prompted as my brightly yolked eggs coagulated before me. I held the handle of the piping-hot pan with my palm facing up, as Child instructs in The French Chef, and maneuvered my omelet onto a warm plate.In La Pitchoune, the name of her cottage tucked in the peaceful hills of Châteauneuf de Grasse in the south of France, Child cooked and shared meals with M.F.K. Fisher, James Beard, and other figures who helped introduce French cuisine to American home cooks in the 1970s.Now affectionately called La Peetch, the house is available as a vacation rental, wedding venue, or — as my mom, grandmother, and I enjoyed it last April — the Courageous Cooking School, where up to six guests can spend a week living in Child's enchanting former home, cooking anything from bouillabaisse to boeuf Bourguignon in a relaxed, recipe- and rules-free setting. There is also plenty of time to enjoy the pool, garden, and neighboring donkey with French wine, cheese, and a good book in hand.For us, day one of the Courageous Cooking School started with omelets. Before we entered the kitchen, we had a lecture of sorts in the living room: the omelet episode of Child's cooking show, The French Chef.""How about dinner in half a minute?"" Child practically sings, a pan of eggs bubbling before her. She cheerfully describes the standard omelet as flat, French, and ""very lovely and tender and soft.""From the time the eggs hit the hot buttered pan, it really does take only 20 seconds to cook.The dish is simple in composition; the only ingredients are butter, two to three eggs (any more, and the omelet takes longer to cook and becomes leathery), salt, and pepper, plus a teaspoon of water whisked into the eggs. (Child doesn't say why, but it's likely to create steam to make the eggs fluffier.)The secret is really in the choreography of the swirl, jerk, and flip. To master the three-step movement, you need confidence, speed, and the right pan, which must have a handle. A good nonstick, preferably one with sloped, two-inch-high sides and a sevenish-inch diameter, does the trick.But this will all be for naught if the pan is cold. For the fluffiest eggs, Child says to place the pan over maximum heat, then add the butter, which should sizzle and foam right away. When there's an even coating of melted butter and the bubbling has subsided, the pan is hot enough for the eggs.Then it's time for the movement. The swirl is easy enough; you simply maneuver the pan in clockwise circles on the burner.The jerk requires a bit more grit.""Don't be shy!"" the instructor encouraged as I timidly swung my elbow back and forth in Child's kitchen, the eggs unmoving. With only 20 seconds to cook the omelet, there was no room for hesitation.Trying to embody Child's confidence, I took a deep breath and yanked my elbow backward, willing the eggs to fold onto themselves like hers.Success.For an omelet that is baveuse, or moist and soft, you should flip it onto the plate while the topside still looks a bit runny. This will result in what Child calls ""lightly coagulated eggs with a little cloak around, holding them together."" Hold the panhandle with the palm of your dominant hand facing up, then turn the pan to invert the omelet onto a plate.Due to the delay caused by my initial lack of jerking valor, my omelet was a bit past baveuse by the time I flipped it. But brushed with a pat of butter for shine, garnished generously with chopped parsley, and arranged on a lime-green plate, it could have passed for Child's from afar. And it tasted pretty darn good.When we Courageous Cooking School students parted ways after our week at La Peetch, we practiced 20-second omelets at home, sending each other photos of our progress.One of us tried a fines herbes version with fresh chives, tarragon, and chervil beaten into the eggs. Another made Child's hearty version with cooked bacon, potatoes, and scallions, sprinkled onto the omelet between the swirling and jerking steps.A year later, I find myself living alone during the coronavirus lockdown. With plenty of free time for cooking failures and successes—and no roommates to listen to the unbearable scratching sound of a pan swirling on the stove—it feels like the perfect opportunity to make a 20-second omelet.Child offers plenty of solutions, of course, if you falter on your first few tries. You can use two forks (or your hands) to groom any messy bits on the plate. If you have trouble swirling and jerking, you can practice with uncooked beans.And if you're still not satisfied, you can always try again tomorrow. It'll only take two eggs and 20 seconds of your time.Makes: 1 servingTime: 20 secondsWhisk eggs, salt, pepper, and water until the yolks and whites are just combined; do not over-beat.Heat a nonstick pan over high heat. Add the butter, which should sizzle immediately, and move the pan around to coat. When butter is completely melted and all bubbling and foaming have subsided, add the eggs.The eggs should begin to bubble right away. Allow them to set for about 5 seconds, then swirl the pan clockwise, keeping the pan in contact with the heat. Continue swirling until the eggs begin to coagulate into a flat circle that lifts from the pan, about 3 seconds.Jerk the pan toward you a few times until the omelet folds over itself, becoming about a third of its original diameter.Rotate the pan 90 degrees, holding the handle with your dominant hand with your palm facing up and your thumb facing out. Turn the pan over (with the edge of the pan touching the plate) to fold the omelet onto a plate so that the smooth bottom side of the omelet is facing up. Brush with extra butter, if desired, and garnish with parsley. Serve immediately."
What Camille Claudel Brings to Modern Women,"The very first time I saw a work of art made by Camille Claudel up close, I was teaching Modern Art History classes for art undergraduate students. The theme was mainly about the great French artist Auguste Rodin, the sculptor behind Le Penseur (The Thinker). However, I thought dividing his already established space with a lesser-known (and female) artist would bring a necessary dose of criticism to young, promising art students.As many people know, Claudel had a terrible life. She was ignored by her teacher and lover, Rodin. She was locked into a psychiatric hospital by the request of her envious brother, a playwright that probably felt diminished by his sister's artistic talent. Her incarceration was made at a time when anything, and I mean anything, could be used against women to prove them crazy and isolate them from society. Claudel spent the rest of her life switching between psychiatric institutions.As a matter of fact, one of Claudel's work that can be compared to The Thinker, at least in its immediate and most shallow meaning. La Profonde Pensée ou Intimité (The Profound Thought or Intimacy), from 1898, depicts a woman kneeling in front of a fireplace. Her hands are leaning on the marble, her head is down. The figure wears an almost transparent dress and is bare feet.It would be unfair to compare the work with that of Rodin, but unfortunately, it is the best argument that I have at this moment.The Thinker (originally a poetic representation of the poet Dante Alighieri) is known by its extreme expressivity and body manner to show how surrendering to profound thinking can work. Meaning that one does not think only with their mind, but also with their whole body. Rodin is not only presenting a focused thinker; instead, he is lashing out at an entire history of thought that presupposes that humans are their minds (I think, therefore I am, said René Descartes) simply carried by a machine, that is our bodies.The amazing paradox of The Thinker is that, despite its name, it cannot be more bodily, corporeal, that it is.Claudel's thinker can carry the same symbolism, although we see a female figure in a very different situation. Rodin's man is posed in what can be considered an ""intellectual position"" — sitting, chin on hand, doing nothing besides focusing on his own profound thoughts. He is probably the image of a man of letters, a philosopher or mathematician, by the style of the Ancient Greek great thinkers and modern geniuses, that was so common in 1700s and 1800s art — like the curved William Blake's Newton (1795).Claudel's woman, on the other hand, is not alone above a rock processing her ultimate thoughts, but she is in a domestic scene — and this is explicitly posed by the fireplace. Her body language is quite different.Besides thinking, she could be doing anything on the domestic sphere (what we contemporaries would call women's typical multitasking at home). Is she in the kitchen, or maybe the living room? Is she the owner of the house, a bourgeoisie woman, or a maid? What is she lamenting for? I think we should let our imagination wander. In my spectator view, it's almost impossible to get away from the Cinderella image: the poor working woman covered in ashes, but whose dreams might come true.Specialists in art, mainly in modern art, could argue that La Profonde Pensée does not have the same powerful expression or geniality of Le Pensé. That would be fair enough; nonetheless, not always the genius of an artist is the best way to analyse her or his work. In this case, the power of the female thinker seems to be in another realm.Claudel's thinker looks like an ironic comment on the man made by Rodin. If the master's intention was to express a universal aspect of thought and, by consequence, of knowledge (the thinker is not necessarily a man… or is it?), the pupil can show us the reality is quite different.The main place for the production of knowledge is a man's world. But that doesn't mean that women can't think, or do profound thinking. It just means that the legitimized thinking, the one from universities, research institutes, political places of decision, is dominated by the male figure of ""the intellectual"".Many women can relate, in their own personal experiences. Haven't we all been considered, at least once, less smart, capable, intelligent than our male colleagues, even when we surpass them in any of these categories? (I am looking at you, Mrs. Elizabeth Warren!)I have my own share of being considered less smart than men in my professional life. I worked on a research institution and, as a young professional in a young company, I was requested to do all sorts of things besides my main tasks. That seemed ok, why complain?But, a few months after, I got a male coworker, who was much younger and less experienced than me. He was only requested to do his job — like his intellectual tasks and production were protected at any cost. I continued to work in a loop of ""the girl who does everything"" until I finally got out of the company, weakened and frustrated.However, in many moments of my life, I also had gender-biased ideas of intelligence. I usually preferred to read male authors, I was a fan of male professors during college, I tended to choose male politicians because I thought they looked more competent for their jobs. I also share my own guilt on being misogynistic against women's intellectual capability. It just changed a few years ago, when I got connected to feminist theory and activism.The American Psychologist Journal published research last year that confirms what we women feel in our everyday lives: even if the working space is becoming more equal, men are still considered more capable to be in charge of ""smart"" jobs than women. Gender stereotypes may be positively changing, but the idea that men are smarter, unfortunately, is indeed challenging to overcome.Camille Claudel taught me to look critically at gender-biased ideas of smartness, intellectual capability. In the first layer, La Profonde Pensée seems like an ironic response to the great and serious intellectual of The Thinker.In a second layer, on the other hand, the artist seems to claim that there is no closed idea of what the intellectual behavior looks like. Our society can recall the male philosopher, naked, thinking, sitting on a rock with the hand under his chin. Or a white, grey-haired CEO or College Professor wearing marine suits. Nonetheless, women suggest other images of what intellectual thinking can look like.Claudel proposed an introspected, almost depressed woman with her head down, absorbed in the domestic scene. But we can suggest other images. Intellectual women can be a sage old woman with a scarf tied to her head and generations of popular knowledge flowing through her veins. Intellectual women who keep family shit together, the house tidy, and still works their Ph.D. thesis after the kids go to sleep.The image of the intellectual woman can be different from men, and that's okay. I think it's valuable to remember it when imposter syndrome hits hard on us.Women have different expectations about being smart. We just need to understand and struggle for it. Goddess knows what would happen if Camille Claudel had this opportunity in her days."
I Tried All the Mac Apps for Designers. Here Are the Ones I Can’t Live Without.,"My Mac is my design studio, writing room, communications center, and remote office. I'm always interested in finding better tools for my job — tools that are as beautiful as they are functional. Many people hate switching apps, but I love it. A few months ago, I was a loyal user of the collaborative interface design app Sketch; now I use Figma. A couple years ago, I was creating flow diagrams in Omnigraffle; now it's Overflow. I've used every email app under the sun and switched note-taking apps more times than I care to admit.Here are the Mac apps I'm using all the time these days, in alphabetical order.$2.99/month (individual); $4.99/month (family)You're using a password manager, right? Right? If you're not, this is the one to get. 1Password recently switched to a subscription model (who hasn't?), a move that frustrated some users. Still, for something as important as the security of your password data, I think it's worth it to know the app is up to date on all the latest threats. I use 1Password to store everything from logins to software licenses, credit cards to important documents. It has robust browser integration and cross-platform, cross-device support. Sort of a very secure Swiss Army knife for your personal data.FreeAnytime I use a Mac without the search app Alfred, I feel sad. Relying on the Mac's native Spotlight feature isn't exactly awful. In fact, it's pretty nifty. But once you realize how much more efficient and productive you can be with Alfred, you'll never look back. Every search I do starts with Alfred, whether it's for a file on my Mac, the weather forecast, someone in my contacts, products on Amazon, movies nearby, Google—really, anything. I recommend leveling up with a PowerPack purchase (£25, single user; £45, single user with free lifetime upgrades) so you can get the most from powerful workflows and utility add-ons.$1.49/month; $14.99/yearLast year, Apple Notes won me back from other note-taking apps. Recently, however, I gave the latest version of Bear a try, and I switched yet again. Bear isn't necessarily more powerful than Apple Notes, but it's a helluva lot prettier. I know some people are into the more robust newcomers like Agenda or Notion, but I like my notes how I like just about everything else: simple.$19 (single license); multi-license discounts availableI take a ton of screenshots, and I've tried a ton of screenshot utilities. But for the past couple years I've been quite happy with CleanShot. It has some killer features, like floating previews that let you add annotations and edits. You can save screenshots wherever you like or copy to the clipboard, record video or animated GIFs, hide all desktop icons, change desktop color, and more. CleanShot is really simple to use and quite powerful to boot.$9.99Here's another menu bar utility I find myself using daily, if not hourly. Grab colors from anywhere on your monitor, and ColorSnapper saves the values in whatever format you prefer — RGB, hex, HSL, and others. When you capture a color, the code is copied to your clipboard, ready for you to use wherever you like. The menu bar shows your recent color snaps, and the floating palette shows you even more details and includes the ability to mark colors as favorites for future use.$6.99Contrast is a really simple yet powerful menu bar utility that checks colors for accessibility. Like most good menu bar utilities, it does just one thing but does it really well.Free (basic); $2.92/month (premium)I keep journals to capture everything from project ideas to memories to inspiration, each in their own journal. DayOne is a simple but powerful cross-platform journaling app that supports syncing, multiple journals, images and videos, reminders, and more. By the way, this is another app that switched to a subscription model, with the attendant user frustration. But, again, I like supporting the developers who make my life just a little bit better with their products.$4.99/month; $39.96/yearI have a love/not-so-love relationship with Fantastical, but I keep it around because it's by far the most elegant cross-device calendar app available. It can be a bit of a memory hog, different calendar systems sometimes don't play nicely with it, and it's not cheap (compared to a free calendar app, say). On the other hand, the fact that I can use natural language to enter items is just so huge that I feel like I can't live without it. Fantastical is an example of Charles Eames' dictum, ""The details are not the details. They make the design."" Here it's epitomized by lovely unexpected touches, like a weather view for today and a few days going forward.Free (basic); $12/month per editor (professional); $45/month per editor (organization)I could write an entire post about my team's switch from the collaborative interface design app Sketch to Figma, but there are enough of those already. I'll make it short: Where Sketch was revolutionary, Figma is evolutionary. Features like group collaboration and cloud storage make Figma feel like the modern app Sketch should have become — or where it's trying to go. There's no doubt Figma has had a huge impact on how we work together — for the better.$29.99If you write, you need an environment that lets you focus on just the words in front of you. That's why I love iA Writer. It's a dead-simple text editor that supports markdown and not much else. One feature I particularly like is the ability to publish directly to Medium, WordPress, or Ghost from within the app. It also has focus modes, including sentence, paragraph, and typewriter, to keep you, well, focused.$0.99Remember, kids, if you're a designer, you must never use filler text. Okay, back to reality: We all have to use filler text sometimes. LittleIpsum is a menu bar utility that lets you select words, sentences, or paragraphs, and then instantly copies them to your clipboard as plain text for use wherever you need them. Shhh… don't tell the UX gurus.Free (basic); $12.50/month or 119.88/year (professional)Milanote is a great tool for organizing creative projects into beautiful visual boards. It feels like the old days when we'd post all our notes, ideas, inspiration, and sketches on the studio wall. Organic. I use Milanote for everything from mood boards to outlining product requirements and a bunch of stuff in between. And like any decent modern app, it lets you share and collaborate with others. Bonus: The basic plan is free. Once you get in the groove, you'll be surprised at all the ways you can use Milanote.Free (basic editor); $2.49/month or $19.99/year (MindNode Plus)A lot of people are talking about the power of mind-mapping. Truth be told, I don't do enough of it, but whenever I do, I find it to be an incredibly powerful way to get my thoughts out of my head and into the world. The problem is that most mind-mapping apps feel unwieldy and bloated, like Microsoft Word for ideating. As a longtime if infrequent user of MindNode, I admire that the developers have exercised restraint, keeping the app as basic (and beautiful) as possible. I love the outline view for jotting down words and then stringing them together into a map afterward. Support for iOS means you can get your mind map on wherever you like.$9.99Noizio is a white-noise utility that, like other white-noise utilities — shuts out the rest of the world and lets you focus. It's also pretty. Noizio offers a wide variety of sounds like Deep Space, Campfire, October Rain, and Paris Café. Despite the options, Pink Noise is still my go-to ambient noise. (And it always makes me wonder: Why does no white-noise app include the sound of a real-world white-noise machine?)$15/month; $144/yearI was invited to beta test Overflow a couple years ago, and my mind was blown: Here was the flow diagramming software I'd always wanted. Since then, the developers have continued to make it better with each release. I use it for everything from user journeys to state diagrams to wire flows. You can share your flows with others and collect feedback. The presentation mode is really nifty as it lets you swoop around your diagrams, focusing on specific areas as you like.$0.99/month; $9.99/yearYes, I'm paying a subscription fee for a clipboard manager. Yes, that's probably nuts. But Paste is like magic. Everything you copy is captured to a dock-like ribbon at the bottom of your screen. You can see your clipboard history, which is highly visual and organized in nature. You can even search your clipboard history (""I just know I copied a recipe for caramel corn last week!"") or save and organize specific clips you think you're going to use on a regular basis. Support for paste as plain text is helpful, too.$20.99/month (standalone)No matter how I try, I can't pry myself away from Photoshop. I tried Affinity Photo because Affinity Designer was such a great alternative to Illustrator, but Photoshop just won me back. And yes, I use and admire Pixelmator, but something about Photoshop has cast a spell on me. Maybe it's just the fact I've been using it longer than almost any other software — 25 years. Before it even supported layers! It's like an old friend. It's second nature to me, and nothing else has felt as complete yet intuitive.$39 (single user)From the same people who brought us CleanShot (see above), PixelSnap is the most powerful screen measurement tool I've come across. You can take detailed measurements of almost anything on your screen by clicking and dragging, plus you can drag around objects to get their precise dimensions. It also supports saving your measurements as screenshots. Bam!$11/month (individual); $42/month (team); enterprise availableThis is a hard one to write, because for two years I was absolutely smitten with Flinto for prototyping. ProtoPie is not necessarily more elegant or easy to use than Flinto; in fact, it's a little more complex. But that complexity brings power. ProtoPie is not without quirks, like allowing you to import only one screen from your design at a time or rasterizing everything instead of retaining vectors. But it makes up for those quirks by letting you create incredibly robust interactive prototypes you can view on your device, share on the web (with comments and collaboration), or preview in the app itself. (Yes, I know Figma supports prototyping, but it supports it the same way Sketch, Studio, and XD do, which is to say, basically not at all. If you need to create even slightly complex interaction mockups, more than a click-through, you'll need a tool like ProtoPie or Flinto.)$39Rotato is another tool I have a love/not-so-love relationship with. It's a mockup generator like none other I've used. It lets you create some of the most gorgeous 3D mockup stills and animations I've seen, but its interface can be frustrating and buggy. And yet I keep coming back to it when I need to create a polished device mockup because of the quality of the mockups it creates. It's pretty intuitive overall, but again, it's not without its quirks. On the other hand, every time I launch Rotato, it prompts me to update to the latest version, so clearly the developers are committed to improvement.FreeI'm a committed inbox zero person, so I'm pretty finicky about my email experience. Having used and fallen in love with many email clients over the years, including AirMail, Sparrow, Mailbox, and Thunderbird, I can say without equivocation that Spark is the best, most elegant email client I've used thus far and, in my opinion, the best available at the moment.Free (with ads); $9.99/month (premium)I include Spotify only because when I'm not using Noizio (see above), I'm listening to music on my Mac. And, again, another love/not-so-love relationship. I love the library and the recommendations Spotify provides, but the UI isn't exactly intuitive. And, hey, Spotify? Leave my podcasts alone. Yes, I'm a subscriber, but I don't like walled gardens. (If you're looking for a great podcast app, I recommend PocketCasts.)Free for starters; $3/month (premium); $5/month (business teams)I quite literally live by Todoist. Every single thought that comes into my brain is categorized into things I need to take action on or not. List-making is how I've learned to manage my ADD. If action is needed, I add it to Todoist with a keystroke. It's an example of a powerful utility that's also simple and beautiful. Little touches like Karma Goals and natural language input are icing on the cake.So, what did I miss? What Mac apps are you loving these days? Let me know below. And thanks for reading."
Jobs vs. Hoffman — which philosophy is best for designers?,"LinkedIn founder and former PayPal COO, Reid Hoffman famously said:Apple and Pixar founder Steve Jobs, on the other hand, had almost the exact opposite philosophy. He once said:He lived by this philosophy.So, when it comes to UX and UI design, who was right?At my app agency, we help entrepreneurs launch new apps and the question ""when is it ready for release?"" comes up on just about every agile project. For clients, this is usually a more obvious consideration towards the end of development, when bugs are being ironed out and last minute tweaks are being applied. However, considering ‘readiness' in the design phase can be equally important.As a designer you can always keep working, keep refining and keep improving a design. But, at some point you have to put your mouse down and leave your precious baby in the hands of others. Is it OK to hand over a design you are embarrassed by if it means potentially getting to market quickly or should you take your time to perfect it?It all comes down to Hoffman or Jobs. Whose philosophy is the right one for designers?I don't presume to have the answer and I don't think there is an answer that applies universally but I can tell you how I choose to approach it.Here's why:Users will forgive you for the occasional bug. They'll live with a lack of features or content. In fact, as long as you provide that one core service they need and can't get anywhere else, they'll tolerate all kinds of technical shortcomings.In my experience launching over a hundred apps, I can definitively say that Reid Hoffman was right in a technical context. If you want the first mover advantage, getting a minimum viable product to market fast, bugs and all, is the way to go.Nowadays, users have a very low tolerance threshold for poor design though.PayPal was launched in 1998, at the height of the dot com bubble and LinkedIn a few years later. This was a gold rush era. Users didn't have nearly as many choices as they have today. Web design was an entirely new concept for designers. Everyone was learning and nobody had truly mastered the art form. ‘UX designer' wasn't even a job title back then. Design sophistication just wasn't as important. Things have changed though. User experience and interface design has come a long way and user's expectations have moved with it.In 2020, these are some of the big impacts design can have when it comes to launching a new digital product:There's no need to take my word for it though. Just spend half an hour exploring the App Store and Play store. Look at the top ranking apps. Look at the apps with the most positive ratings. Look at the apps Apple and Google are featuring. What do they all have in common? They look great.Of course, look and feel is only half of the story when it comes to design though. At this point it's worth recounting another of Steve Jobs' memorable quotes:By definition, poor design equates to a poor user experience and I think we can all agree that when it comes to designing great experiences, Jobs was the master.So, in adopting Jobs' philosophy as a designer, does this mean you should abandon timelines altogether? Of course not. Designers still have deadlines to meet and clients to appease. What it does mean is using design time effectively to get the best design outcomes. It means suggesting time and budget extensions where you think they are necessary. It means being able to effectively articulate the reasons why spending more time on a particular screen, function or flow will affect the success of the product to stakeholdersFor every startup or new project, there will always be competing priorities. There will never be enough time or money to do everything. Knowing why great design is so important can help you to balance those priorities.Reid Hoffman was right when it comes to development. Acting fast and getting a first mover advantage can be crucial to the success of a new digital product. But when it comes to design, Steve Jobs' philosophy rings truer now than it ever has before. Details matter.Originally published at https://dreamwalk.com.au on April 16, 2020."
Why a Financial Crisis Is Actually the Best Time to Start a Company,"I started my digital marketing company in 2009 against the backdrop of a global financial crisis. Most people thought a young university graduate — like I was at that time — should play it safe and wait for the business climate to get better before starting a company. I'll never forget the middle-aged business owner who approached me at a trade show and suggested I was ""very courageous"" to start a company in ""the crisis,"" and wished me well as if I were taking a trip to some dangerous place from which I would never return.My youthful ignorance turned out to be a blessing, although the first two years of bootstrapping were painfully humbling. My business card read ""CEO,"" but in reality, I was sleeping on an airbed under my desk. Two years later, armed with the proof of concept for our business model and bolstered by the tailwind of the improving economy, I raised my first round of financing. Eventually, I assembled a fantastic team of hundreds of people and later sold the majority of the company to a media conglomerate. It was a great ride, and I now believe that starting my company during a recession was the best move I could have made.According to a 2009 study by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, an extraordinary 57% of Fortune 500 companies have been founded in a recession or bear market, even though only 31% of all years since 1855 counted as ""down years.""If the majority of these companies got started during rough economic periods, it suggests that they may not be bad times to start a company. A ""bad time to start a company"" usually implies low consumer demand and limited access to funding. But that's mainly a problem for startups that are already established. They have to manage the decline, after all.With no legacy costs, no draining layoffs, and no bank calling you to cut the credit line, entrepreneurs who start companies now can focus on building a great new product or service. Starting with a blank slate is your advantage in 2020. This year, the competition is weak, and you can gain an advantage that might last for years.In the world of startups, there is no guaranteed formula for success, but you need at least four ingredients to avoid failure: a good idea, an outstanding team, enough funding, and a way to find customers.Here's what that looks like in the current crisis of 2020.Great ideas usually either solve a real, significant problem or make life considerably easier. Think of great startup ideas as painkillers: People need them and are willing to pay. The year 2020 will produce a whole range of ""painkiller-category"" problems that will translate into entrepreneurial opportunities.Millions of children can't attend school. How can you solve that? Visit any quarantined household with small children. Those parents surely have a litany of new problems in need of a solution. Tens of millions of workers have gotten laid off. Hundreds of thousands of urban storefronts will be left empty by shuttered restaurants and struggling retailers. What will fill the voids in 2021?Problems create opportunities, and 2020 is not lacking in problems. It's no coincidence that companies like Uber or Airbnb were founded and thrived after the last financial crisis. They solved real problems (""I need extra cash"") and made life easier (""I want a cheaper, easier option"") at the right time.Finding great employees has historically been one of the biggest bottlenecks for startups. Here's the biggest reason to start a company in 2020: For the first time in the last five years, you're going to have access to an abundant pool of amazing talent. In 2019, companies had to bend over backward to attract great people. Outstanding employees were spoiled by poaching offers from competing companies. That drove rising salary levels and the frequency of job-hopping.Today, the pandemic has forced millions of qualified, hard-working employees to be let go by their firms. Some of them — maybe you among them — will take matters in their own hands and create a startup. Others will be thrilled to be working for one.In 2020 it will get much easier to compete for talent and retain employees. Perks like free kombucha, Disneyland furniture, and daily yoga classes at work suddenly sound so ""2019"" now. This year, offer meaningful work with good pay and possibly some stock options and people will gladly assemble their own Ikea furniture to work for you. Add to that the possibility of worldwide recruiting, which the work-from-home explosion has accelerated, and your inbox will be overflowing with applications.Now you might be thinking, ""This sounds all well and good, but it will be impossible to raise any money in 2020.""I don't agree. But before I address why, let's clear something up: I think the last five years were a fake environment of fundraising. It felt like anybody and their dog could raise a $1 million seed round if they walked straight and put together 20 PowerPoint slides. There was so much money available that a company was able to raise $120 million dollars to build a $400 machine to squeeze juice from a plastic bag.These times are probably over, but venture capitalists and angel investors are still here and still have money to invest. It will undoubtedly become harder to raise funds in 2020 compared to 2019. The 2020 funding environment will favor outstanding founders. They will still raise rounds, and the mediocre startups will suffer. But who wants to be mediocre anyways?Let's consider a temporary shortage of capital a good thing. Less funding means the quality of entrepreneurship will rise again. Fewer dollars will force everyone to work harder and get better. In my first two years after starting up, I would think three times before spending a dime. For example, we would never pay for any sales leads datasets but instead hack together a script to scrape such data from public sites for free. This instilled a culture of frugality that lasted much longer than the actual bootstrapping phase.In normal times, nobody needs a $50 million Series A round six months after starting their company. A lot of such rounds led to premature scaling and created more damage than value. Potentially good companies like WeWork blitzscaled straight into trouble.Use the temporary shortage of capital to your advantage and foster a culture of frugality and wits. No business-class flights or $1,000 office chairs. The leaner you operate, the better.When I started my digital marketing company in the financial crisis, a lot of companies had shredded their advertising budget. So needless to say, our products didn't sell like hotcakes. But we knew there were still businesses out there that were doing well and who needed our services. Our job was to be smart and find them.As a founder, your job in the first year is to build something that 100 people love, rather than something that 10,000 people kind of like. If you do an excellent job of creating something valuable, you'll find those 100 people, no matter if it's the year 2020, 2009, or 2001. That is the first stage for most startups, and during this stage, the macroeconomic environment just doesn't matter so much. It will easily take one or two years until you have genuinely figured out product-market fit.Take advantage of the low advertising prices as well. If you truly offer something that people need, now is the best time to attract users cheaply. With marketing budgets cut down to almost zero in a lot of cases, you'll be able to buy low-priced ad inventory, especially in digital channels.The next couple of years in a downturn environment will be your training day. The sales you make will be the hardest of your life. The fundraising will be slow and cumbersome, especially if you're a first-time founder. You will get scars. But those kinds of scars will make you great in the future.Fortune hunters who are just in the game for easy money are likely to leave the scene during this crisis. But real entrepreneurs will enter the arena and stick around. Entrepreneurship is always a tough game with limited resources, no matter when you start. One of my mentors would always say: ""As a founder, you have to eat concrete."" You'll face a thousand setbacks in your journey. So you might as well start now when everyone else is too scared to join the race. You'll have a head start."
How to Promote Your App: The Definitive Guide for 2020,"Marketing an app isn't easy. Four million apps exist and people only use nine apps a day. Not to mention, getting people to use your app, stick around, and tell their friends & family about it is even harder. However, having a great marketing strategy in place is the first piece in executing a million piece puzzle.At the end of the day, marketing is about experimenting. The only way to find out what works is to just do that thing. So I've compiled a list of the most effective app marketing tactics in the book in no particular order.This took me 14 hours and five years of first-hand, brutal experience in the industry to put together so please take all of this to heart rather than the regurgitated app marketing fluff articles you'll probably read after you leave this article.[Last updated April 17, 2020]70% of app downloads come directly from the App Store search.They say the best place to hide a body is on the second page of Google search results. The same can be said for apps. If you're not showing up within the top ten for relevant keywords, you're practically dead.Throwing money at advertising is your only other option which is not sustainable. And if you plan on raising funds, it's a massive red flag to not have a source of organic traffic. ASO is the foundation of any marketing strategy, so investing time, money, and energy into this strategy is one of the best things to do. If you're looking to work with some amazing ASO people, Apptuitive is pretty great.Again, and I quote, four million apps exist. True innovation, unique ideas, and great execution are getting harder and harder to come by. Just good isn't enough anymore and having the ""if you build it they will come"" mentality is extremely detrimental.Marketing starts with the product itself. I can't say it better than Seth Godin:The mindset of approaching marketing for anyone, especially bootstrappers, is to elegantly slide into existing communities. Elegantly slide meaning don't kick open the door and immediately start screaming about your app.One of the easiest ways to do this is to get in touch with key community gatekeepers early, ideally as soon as you're set on developing the idea. The earlier the buy-in and the more the other person feels included, the better. And when I say gatekeepers, I mean influencers, community organizers, established subject matter experts, and anyone with an engaged audience.You have the app and they have the people. Both can't work without the other. This engagement might look like splitting shares, working on a fixed-price basis, or even for free if the other person truly sees the value of the app idea.""Founder's ego"" blows me away. I've witnessed countless amounts of founders stunt marketing endeavors in so many different ways, it's actually insane. To name a few:Pride cometh before a fall.Paid to Free is exactly what it sounds like. The strategy is to launch as a Paid app, anywhere from $5–10, then make the app free a couple of days later. You'll get on the radar of popular app directories and have word of mouth referrals as a byproduct.Some app marketing experts charge thousands to even share this basic information with their clients, but without further ado, here's how to execute a paid to free campaign:Before you run this, it's key to ensure the app is working properly. The last thing you want is thousands of users onboarded onto a buggy app and getting bombarded with negative reviews, which is extremely hard to climb out of. Note that you cannot change a free app to a paid app on Google.Stuart Hall wrote a case study, ""How I got 2.3 million app downloads (without spending a cent on marketing)"" and outlined this exact strategy. TLDR: 216k+ downloads in 3 days, an average of 72k/day, up from an average of 28/day at paid, or over 2500x. The app became the #1 fitness iPad app in 68 countries, and the #1 fitness iPhone app in 49 countries.If your app is complementary to another app, consider cross-promotion. Of course, it's ideal for both parties have to bring an equal amount of value to the table, but if you have the lower-hand in the situation, it's probably worth doing more if the other app has an existing audience.The prime example of this is the Nike Training Club and Headspace partnership.Headspace meditation was flawlessly integrated into NTC to provide athletes mindful guided runs and the partnership happened right when meditation started to take off in the app stores.Although I couldn't find the ROI of the partnership, I imagine things are going extremely well as it's been two years since the partnership has rolled out and it's still in place.Plus, somewhat unrelated, the co-branded promotional and in-app graphics are just perfect. *Chef's kiss*Apple Search Ads' average conversion rate is 50% and for Universal Ad Campaigns, advertisers that optimize for in-app actions, on average, drive 140% more conversions per dollar than other Google app promotion products. App store search works people, it's all about intent.Healthy advertising budgets start at $5k-$10k/month. If you don't have that marketing budget, experimenting with $50/day is also interesting for kicks & giggles, but again, if you don't have a marketing budget of at least $5k/month, you're better off skipping this section and investing money in a different channel.If you want something done right, hire a qualified intern that has a good head on their shoulders. Just give them defined instructions.Now there are paid internships and unpaid educational internships. If you have the money to pay that person, pay them. If you really can't afford to, offer them an unpaid educational internship for college credit.Please note, unpaid does not mean you can exploit your intern. If you go down this route, you need to offer an amazing, resume-elevating, network opening, informative experience. Don't risk getting sticky with the law, because there's a very fine line when it comes to intern expectations. You can read more on unpaid internship rules here.This is in the same vein of hiring an intern but recruiting brand ambassadors is different. Unlike interns who work part-time to gain real-world experience, brand ambassadors are solely responsible for spreading the word about and representing said brand.Brand ambassadors are extremely popular with dating apps, for example. What better way to reach hot & bothered singles than college campuses? Both Tinder & Bumble took off because their roots were established in sororities & fraternities at just the right time.One popular strategy both brands ran with was working with influential students to throw parties at bars and frat houses, the catch was that one couldn't get in without downloading the app.Once Tinder and Bumble had the campus social butterflies within a 5-mile radius of each other having success with the apps, word of mouth took care of the rest.Having a strong presence on campus if your app is for students or 18–25-year-olds is a great strategy. Birds of a feather flock together, and if you know anything about network effects, you'll know that there are few places like college campuses that are ripe for a word of mouth ripple effect.Shake hands with everyone. Your network is your net worth, and you literally never know who will be instrumental in the growth of your startup/side hustle.I'm actually extremely confident in saying success depends on the quality of people you meet. Getting non-fluffy, real answers from experienced people in the startup world will keep you from making the same mistakes they did.""Doing the things that don't scale"" is a phrase popularized by Paul Graham, the co-founder of Y Combinator. It means exactly what it sounds like. It's the most practical tip in the book because there's no such thing as taking shortcuts when you're building a business. There's no growth hack or secret pill to reach success.If you're looking for a list of ideas for inspiration there's an entire crowdsourced list at dothingsthatdontscale.Rule of thumb for marketing, the more relevant your product is to today, the better.This is an extreme example, but a client of mine, SHOCK Women's Fitness, revamped all marketing efforts when COVID-19 hit. The founders gave away the app for free and reaped extremely positive upsides because of it.Of course, there's a difference between being relevant and opportunistic, but it all comes down to intent. The closer you can tie messaging or campaigns to holidays, current events, social trends, etc., the better.Just like ASO, SEO is equally important for certain apps. Most relevant searches are obviously done in the app store, but if you can get ahead in Google search as well, why not?There are literally thousands of articles on SEO so I don't want to sit here and ramble on, however, here are a few pieces of SEO advice:Ratings & reviews especially play a huge role in marketing as it signals to the app stores that there's a demand for the app and that the user is having a positive experience.A key strategy is to prompt that ""leave a review"" pop-up after the user completes a main action in the app. For example, if you have a photo editing app you could prompt the user to leave a review right after the photo is successfully edited and saved to that person's photo gallery.Matt Galligan wrote the best article on app ratings and these are the results he saw after implementing the advice laid out in ""The right way to ask users to review your app"":In addition to just asking your users for app ratings & raving reviews, you need to make sure you're actually walking the walking. Listening and personally responding to reviews shows your users that they're appreciated.Lifehack in general, but mirroring the user's language will show them that you're listening and not just yes-ing them to death.It actually improves the UX and your business as a whole, so it's in your best interest to treat every user as you would your newborn child.Press is the best. If you land the right placements you'll essentially start a massive snowball effect. I've been on both sides of pitching, so I can say first-hand that it is not easy. Here are the golden Do's & Don'ts of pitching:Dont'sDo'sHere's an example of an app that got featured on The Next Web:Wakeout hit its goal of 10k new users from press alone. The app also went on to secure a worldwide Apple feature that lasted a week, driving 210k more downloads.I don't mean this in a sarcastic way at all, but in all honesty, the only person that will be able to figure the most effective, clever marketing strategies, if you don't have thousands to spend on a marketing consultant, is you. The only way to get experience is to experiment. And again, there's really no ""perfect way"" to go about marketing. It's all trial & error and figuring out which channels work best.And don't be stupid with money. I once went to a launch party where a couple of hundred dollars was spent just on having an eye-piercing, red sports car by the entrance for three hours. To this day, I still can't believe it was real.Marketing does not equal selling. In fact, the easiest way to sell something is not selling anything. If people really need your app, they're going to be interested just based on the value proposition.If you're posting from a Facebook page in hopes of gaining traffic, you are going to be posting on Facebook until the end of the world. Using Facebook for organic reach is the equivalent of standing in the middle of a desert talking to yourself about your new app. Organic reach is hovering around 1% these days.However, if you do have an advertising budget, Facebook is obviously a great platform. It helped elect a President!If you want to learn more about running effective app install campaigns check out this blog post by Branch Metrics.If you just use Instagram for the sake of using Instagram, there's no point in using Instagram. As of 2020, it's still the platform to be on, however, you're competing for eyeballs along with every other brand, friend, family member, and meme account.That said, you need to think of Instagram as your target user's mood board. Disregard the notion that Instagram is solely aesthetic-looking photos because it's not just that anymore. People love apps that are intertwined with their lifestyle and Instagram should reflect a broader understanding of that.Strava does a great job with their feed. The company boasts amazing, unique data and they show it through data visualization/shareable infographics.There's also a healthy mix of inspiring real-life marathon shots, motivational photos, and user highlights. It's not obnoxiously branded or heavily self-promotional, it's just right.If your brand is opinionated, which it should be, use Twitter. It's a great place to converse 1–1 with potential users and be a part of relevant conversations.Cash App probably isn't the most relevant example to point to, however, it's the most engaging example I could think of.Cash App promotes it's own hashtag every so often, asking followers to tweet them their ""cashtag"" or username. They do this to choose a random person to send money to via their app. No one can say no to free money, so it's prime marketing at it's finest. Of course, not everyone has money to just give away, but coming up with clever strategies along the lines of Cash App pays off dividends.Reddit is the antithesis of spam. Only use Reddit if you plan on being an active part of the community. Ideally, you should be heavily vested in the startup community if you really want to get the most bang for your buck here. Each subreddit is highly-engaged and there's always great information being poured into the ecosystem every day.It's also good to note that Reddit heavily skews male, so if your target demo is guys 21–40 years old this is a nice place to chat it up.Producing quality content is expensive, whether it comes at a time or monetary cost. Producing high-quality videos is definitely a mix of both.Youtube isn't for everyone because it is a very saturated platform, however, if you're running an ed-tech startup I'd highly recommend looking at either sponsoring relevant videos in your niche or starting a channel on your own.50% of people use YouTube to learn new things, making the platform practically a goldmine for education-based apps.I worked on Mechanisms by Alchemie and we went forward with this same strategy. The majority of our target users who studied organic chemistry were going to YouTube to learn. So we started showing up where they were.Remember, 80% of people remember what they see, compared to 10% of what they hear, and 20% of what they read. The more visual content you put out, the better.Put on your Gen Z pants, because if your target audience is 24 yrs and/or younger, you need to use TikTok yesterday. The organic reach is off the charts and if you can create or sponsor great content, you'll hit the jackpot.A handful of smart photography and visual-focused apps are killing the game. The key is integrating the app into the video in a non-salesy way. In fact, the best app-related content doesn't even seem like selling at all, it's purely entertainment. Let people organically ask what the app is because they're so interested, without you even saying anything.Cole & Tezza, lovers & founders of the Tezza app, pull this off flawlessly.Tezza is a photo & video editing app with a target audience of 15–35-year-old women, most likely. The founders take advantage of the lifestyle angle that photo editing apps inherently have and intertwine it with their lives.The TikToks that mention the app are beautifully integrated in a non-intrusive, highly-entertaining way. It doesn't feel like selling at all, and users are intrigued enough to actually download the app for themselves.Tezza is the absolute golden example of what any strategy should look like on TikTok. *Chef's kiss*This goes in hand with something I'll touch on next, which is working on your personal brand, but I want to focus on LinkedIn.LinkedIn is the perfect platform to connect with professionals in the same vertical as you, and it's also a great place to connect with fellow startup heads. LinkedIn organic reach is great, not as good as it once was, but it's still effective. Document your startup/app journey and people will follow. People mindlessly consume anything these days.LinkedIn Sales Navigator, in particular, is fantastic, especially if you're looking to raise money. You can search for anyone based on job titles, regions, countries, and more. It's like Facebook stalking, but less creepy.It's ideal to have a warm intro, but no matter who you're cold messaging, a potential user, investor, employee, etc, you need to make sure you actually have a decent understanding of the person and personalize your intro message. There's nothing that will trigger an immediate delete than a generic ""Hi, I'd like to connect.""Who doesn't love a good founder's story? But really, any positive press you get as a founder pays off for whatever you're building. One of the best tips I could possibly give anyone is to sign up for HARO, which stands for ""Help A Reporter Out."" Journalists everywhere are always on the hunt for new stories to cover. So if you're a subject matter expert in your field, take advantage of it.You'll receive morning, afternoon, and evening inquiries in your inbox every workday. Checking on them needs to be a habit because you never know what you might miss.All you need to do is find pitches most relevant to your app, and reply with the information the journalist is looking for. Massive returns for little to no effort.I wouldn't say event crawling is the best use of your time, but I'm including it because I know a few people who have had success with this.You need to know what you want out of the event before you even step foot through the door. Are you trying to find a co-founder? Are you recruiting brand ambassadors? Are you looking for an investor? Having a clearly defined goal will allow you to focus and make sure your time is being spent wisely. Meetup is great.You really need to talk your face off and take advantage of every single relevant conversation you find yourself in as a startup founder. Again, you never know who you're going to run into or who is going to tell who what. Just don't turn into a car salesman every interaction you have.Marketing isn't a mystical, magical thing. There's no need to reinvent the wheel. Top apps get to where they are because they're either funded out the wazoo or executed on the tactics listed in this article at the right time. That said, low-hanging fruit is stalking your competitors for ideas and executing them, but better.If you have an iOS app, or even Android, one of the fastest ways to get a ton of downloads is to land an app store feature, which is easier said than done.The strategy you need to take here is the same as pitching the press. Stay straight to the point and keep it short, and then punch them in the face. Apple has to see hundreds, if not thousands, of feature pitches a day. You need to stand out.That said, it's good to mention why iPhone users need this app, as well as mentioning any iterations the app has been through. Apple loves seeing real solutions and continual positive UX improvements.Here are key points to include:I'd highly recommend watching Niall Ferguson's docu-series, Networld, or researching anything on network effects. Again, relying on advertising and dropping dollars is unsustainable. You need to focus on maximizing organic channels as much as you possibly can.I'm not using the word viral here because it has a negative connotation to me. The people who say they want virility mean they want an easy, quick way to a bajillion downloads and bam that's it. That's not realistic at all.Read this article by Eric Jorgenson for more information if you're curious.Guerrilla marketing is essentially a marketing strategy in which a company uses unconventional ways to promote their product. Think of it like extreme creative publicity. Foursquare pulled off a solid guerrilla marketing stunt back in 2010 at SXSW.The startup didn't have the traditional SXSW exhibit, so they were left to their own devices. Instead of setting up a booth or actual tech exhibit at the convention, Foursquare set up an actual game of 4-square with just a piece of chalk and a rubber ball.Dennis Crowley, Foursquare CEO said:The company gained 100k users from this tactic and all it took was being at the right place at the right time with a ball and some chalk.Everyone vividly remembers any time they were surprised. The same can be said for startup/app brands. Bumble once sent me a bouquet of flowers, and in that moment, I practically became a word of mouth slave of them.Screenshot from author's twitterYou don't have to go to the extent of sending every person flowers, however, going out of your way definitely leaves a lasting impression. When you're especially onboarding your first 100 users, you need to treat them like royalty and I can't stress that enough. McKinsey once stated that ""word of mouth is the primary factor behind 20–50% of all purchasing decisions. Its influence is greatest when consumers are buying a product for the first time.""You need to turn those first few people into brand warriors. I'd highly recommend reading Kevin Kelly's, ""1,000 True Fans,"" as well. It's almost in the same vein as this piece of advice.If you're not moving forward you're moving backward. The faster you start networking, marketing, and doing everything mentioned in this article the better. There's really no time to waste in this game, so what are you waiting for? Get out there and talk to someone about your baby."
6 Endings To My Personal Pandemic Movie,"We're all living our own version of Steven Soderbergh's movie Contagion, a 2011 thriller about a killer virus that has become a sort of new classic.My personal pandemic movie started in early March. The coronavirus had spread to Europe from China and was finally in America. But I was still riding the New York City subway train to therapy. I went and saw a new production of West Side Story on Broadway. I ate a yellow cheese omelet with a side of coleslaw at a diner. I didn't know at the time how good I had it.The next part of my movie is also probably familiar to many. Empty grocery store shelves. Frantic calls to pharmacies. Closed doors. Panic attacks over the toaster. A morning phone call with terrible, world-breaking news. A test. Weeks in a room, alone, scared. A growing rage at dithering leaders too concerned with saving face than lives. We are all in a life-and-death battle with the plague. Our movies are both different and the same.I humbly present six potential endings to my personal pandemic movie. It's tentatively titled Contagion 2: DeVoravirus. These minutes are not the beginning, nor the second act, nor the climax. I am pretty sure I'm not going to write a screenplay about these strange, dark days but if I did, here are the brief scenes and montages I'd consider before typing FADE OUT. THE END. FYI: I am portrayed by Academy-Award winning actor Matt Damon in each.1.I slowly open the door but the chain lock stops me. ""Go away,"" I whisper through the crack before shutting the door. There is silence. Then the sound of two heavy deadbolts sliding into place. Then silence, again. A Sunday morning quiet. The sound of statues weeping. The entire apartment building, silent. The hallways, the staircases, unblinking eyeballs stare through peepholes.2. I kick open my door. I am ripped after months of pushups in my 500 square-foot Harlem apartment. I am wearing nothing but star-spangled short shorts. I'm also wearing an American flag like a cape. I found it in a trashcan during a 3 AM walk. I tie it around my neck and God bless. There will be more capes in this brave new world! My muscles glisten and glean. I walk outside and inhale the sunbeams. Then I start strutting down the middle of the street singing James Brown's classic '80s hit ‘Livin' In America.' It's a soulful locomotive of an anthem about freedom and road-trippin' and rock and roll and great cities like New Orleans and Atlanta and Pittsburgh. The song is rude and jazzy and I am pumped. You may remember the song from 1985's Rocky IV, a classic drama about an average man versus communism, Karl Marx's enduring political theory that says sharing is nice. Anyway, America finally kicked the coronavirus' ass the way Rocky clobbered Ivan Drago! Fuck yeah. Cars pull over for me. Construction workers stop their jackhammering. People see me from their windows and run to join my march of total awesomeness. I lead a diverse parade of human beings fueled by funk and love, truth and beauty. In Central Park, we all dance naked around a bonfire.3. I wear a mask and patiently stand in line. The mask is an Amazon Prime respirator. You can buy them by the dozens now, along with Super Soaker-sized water guns filled with hand sanitizer. Capitalism didn't break, it just mutated, slowly. When I get to the head of the line I show off a new ID card with my proof of vaccination. I am allowed in by security guards wearing sophisticated respirators and I get into another line where I will eventually order a burrito bowl with chicken, pinto beans, pico de gallo, and extra guacamole.4.""I'm too old to be drafted,"" I shout into the phone. It turns out, I'm not. The war with China is going as well as the initial pandemic response. In the future there are three choices: fight the reds or contract the virus during one of America's now famous ‘freedom outbreaks.' Oh, the third choice is hard labor at a coronavirus colony. Our elected officials thought the nation would forgive and forget their shockingly inept handling of the plague if they started a land war in Asia. They were wrong, again. I tell the recruiter that I'm middle-aged and chubby and have high blood pressure and he told me to cheer up, there's a Pizza Hut on the transport ship. Uncle Sam needs new meat, even if it's past the expiration date. I am then told to report to New York's Javits Center for immediate processing or face exile to Florida.5.I sit on a park bench by a pond. The sun is out. Normally, I sit in the dark in front of three screens: to my left is an endless scroll of updates and information from social media, and to the right real-time readouts of my vital signs: temperature, pulse, respiration rate, and blood pressure. The middle screen is playing Will Smith's 2007 classic I Am Legend, about a war between nocturnal vampires and the last man on Earth, on a loop. I sometimes feel like the last man on earth but I can hear other last men shuffling around in their rooms above and below me, and to both my sides. But today is special. There is a breeze. I feed pigeons crackers I pick up from a local grocery store that is heavily subsidized by the government. I call them my ""Soylent Greenies"" but no one gets the reference. I am allowed to sit at this park once every three months for one hour. When I am done I put the bulky suit back on and head underground.6. We finally get together. It has been a couple of years, but no more. This is not the funeral. That will happen soon enough. He waited this long, he can wait a little longer. The table is full of food: pasta and brisket and fresh rye bread, his recipe or as close as we could get it. A knife is shared. The butter is soft. An old man tells a corny joke. A toddler runs on new legs. There is a brief talk of vaccines and drug cocktails, but we've all had enough of that conversation. I say ‘hello' to someone I haven't seen in a long time. We hug and move on to other friends. Everyone is greyer, more wrinkled, a truth everyone points out. We talk about football and movie theaters and for a few hours, we are not afraid. There is warmth and light and those we've lost watch us from outside through the window and they smile because we're safe and happy for now and so, satisfied, they put their hands in pockets, and walk into the darkness, the glowing window growing smaller and smaller behind them until the only light are the stars underfoot, a midnight stroll to a peaceful place and many, many years from now I'll walk that same twinkling path and they'll be waiting for me. All of them. And we will hug."
Is This How It's Going to Be?,"Our new human better figure out how to do his job!Our new sitter, Steve, was turning out to be a pretty good human. He was trying to follow all the instructions barked out to him by Mandy, the firefighter who had to leave in a hurry. And I was doing my best to help him. Help he desperately needed again, on his second day with us.It was midafternoon. Riva and I followed Steve over to the home of Wombles, Rhonda, and Dottie. Those three know not to mess with the chickens so he let them and Sissie out. If he was a smarter human he would have kept them close. Maybe he thought they were like me.Steve could see that I'm a good girl. I know my job and how to behave. I don't go to the neighbors and harass them. I don't have to be on a leash. That's not true for the others. Steve was about to learn that. He should pay more attention to me. I tried to warn him.The silly human got distracted again. To his credit though, Steve heard me tell him the others had run off to the neighbors. He called them back and they responded. For a moment. But Steve was busy with something and took his eyes off them. Big mistake.I wasn't surprised when Diane pulled up. Of course, with the shenanigans going on at her house, I was expecting her.I like her. She always pets me when she comes over. Diane is one of the humans that live next door. She and Jeff are the people who own our home.I could sense Diane was upset. She was not at all impressed with Steve. She informed him of that, along with her expectations of him and the dogs, and what would happen if they weren't met. She made it clear he had messed up.Diane was right, and I could tell Steve knew it. If he had a tail, it would be tucked. I think what made it worse for him was that she was quite civil. I was impressed. She was cool, intelligent and straightforward. A real lady. Like me.To his credit, Steve accepted responsibility, apologized and promised to never allow the dogs out like that again. Diane left and I went in to get some water. Steve came in with me. That's when we saw it; the mud tracked into the kitchen, on the walls, down the hallway into a bedroom, and then into the living room. I was so mad!The house belongs to me. Well, and Riva, I guess. Those childish fools had made such a mess!Steve let out a big sigh and asked me where the cleaning supplies were. I made a couple of tight circles around the closet. After grabbing the supplies, he plopped down to his knees and kept mumbling something about someone named ""Cinderella"". I hope he starts paying closer attention because Sissy needs his help.You know, as much as I try to teach others to be good, they just don't listen. Sissy wanted to play with the neighbors. She squirmed under the barbed-wire fence yesterday. But she didn't get low enough and that fence ripped a two-inch gash into her side. I think she knew she would be in trouble because she didn't tell Steve about it.The morning after Diane came to visit, I heard Steve hacking. It sounded like he had a furball stuck in his throat. Riva and I had to laugh at him for this. Serves him right, letting that cat into his room and not us. We would have kept her from climbing all over his face.We helped Steve with the morning chores. He found the gash on Sissie's side when he went in to feed them. He liked to stop and pet everyone and say nice things to them. Sissie enjoyed the attention and turned her side to show him what had happened to her. Poor Steve. I could feel his concern. He circled around a couple of times like Riva does when she's looking for a softer spot on her bed. With his head hung low, he went back to the house to get some medicine.After treating Sissie with some salve, and putting on ridiculous-looking strips of cloth, Steve asked me what he should do next. He had no idea that Sissie wasn't going to keep those silly bandages on.""What do you think, Allie? Does Sissie need to see the vet?""A vet? No way! I don't like going to the vet and even though Sissie caused the problem herself by being a bad girl, I didn't think she should have to go to the vet.I was relieved that because it was the weekend, the local veterinary office was closed. The next closest vet was over ninety miles away. Sissie was in luck.A few minutes later, I heard Steve talking to his friend, on the phone. He said he wasn't about to contact our mom, Maya, to tell her he's responsible for her friend being ripped open. At least not until he had some answers. Steve told me that his friend‘s uncle is a veterinarian. He would know what to do. He tapped on the phone again.""What?? $1500 for a few stitches? $900 if no stitches were required?"" Steve growled.I'm not sure what that meant but Steve's heart was thumping louder than usual. I guess it's not what he wanted to hear.I moved over on the couch so Steve could sit. It helps me to sit so I can think. He kept whimpering about how he had never even spoken to Maya. He let his imagination of the pending disastrous conversation make him edgy. I think he was looking for a way to escape the country.He didn't know our mom like we do.After a different vet told Steve that Sissie wouldn't need stitches, his heartbeat slowed and his breathing became easier. He tapped on the phone again.""Hi, Maya."" I jumped up and danced around. I wanted to talk to her. I missed her so much. But all I could do was listen. Steve was being so rude to me.""Sissy should be fine with that cut. No need for a vet — they have had worse cuts when they used to work cows. ‘She probably doesn't need anything beyond what you have done."" I heard Maya say.""Whew!"" Maya is awesome! Steve howled. He was feeling so much better.Me, Steve, and Riva took our seats out on the deck. We crawled up next to him to let him know he would be alright. As we watched the sunset, I couldn't help to wonder if this how things were going to be. Would this silly human figure out how to properly take care of us, or are we in for more trouble?"
We Live in the Blue Ruin,"You are permitted 20 things from the old life before the move. Fingers count. Single eyelashes count. A breath does not. Breathing is a given. Antiseptic is forbidden. Bones, you can have those. Don't bother with your voice — it'll be removed in stages. Besides, no one speaks inside The Blue. People always forget about skin even though it's the one item they'll invariably need — how else will you hold yourself together when you enter The Blue? Baffling. Pairs are a technicality — feet, hands, kidneys, ears, and eyes — you may keep the plurals with some restrictions. For example, you may retain your feet, but you'll have to make tough decisions regarding the toes. Eyes may be preserved, but sight isn't guaranteed. We're not unreasonable people, but there are limits to our generosity. Some of The Originals try to invent loopholes, they lobby for shared items and fractions — if we each preserve 2.5 fingers we'll have an entire right hand! We have to remind them that while they may leave together, they go in alone. The only math up for discussion is subtraction. Know that you will become a passenger in your own body. A thick darkness will cover your face.I'm sorry for your loss, they say to one another as items are discarded. Is that what this is?We will provide you with the latest technology. Our motion sensor keypads will allow you to form paragraphs with the slightest of movements. We can't get into specifics because our techniques are proprietary, but we assure you that our products come with a money-back guarantee. Hunger and thirst will be retired. Most bodily functions will depreciate. You will be assigned a finite number of emotions so as to individualize your experience, but we will monitor your habits and adjust accordingly. We had an incident — you might have read about it in the papers — concerning @grady. We miscalculated the appropriate dosage of desire, and as a result we experienced an unfortunate situation, a contagion. His banal encounter with Super User @felsull was misinterpreted; affection developed (one-sided, of course, because @felsull really didn't have the time since she accumulated one million Likes, Hearts, and Fans!) that resulted in a virus that plagued all of The Blue. He literally gave her his heart, and the virus nearly crashed our servers. Do you know how many cells there are in one human heart? Two billion.What a fucking disaster.Don't worry. We've taken the proper precautions to ensure an affliction of this magnitude doesn't occur again. We've opened up call centers staffed with community managers who actively police the engagements with our most active members, top earners, and emerging talent. Emotions are modulated when appropriate. And yes, our call center staff has been allowed complete use of their limbs — a small investment for the necessary work they do.You will have everything you need to start your new life in The Blue. Here is your Welcome Packet. We suggest you actually read it.A side note — sentimental types tend to carry over an article of clothing, a photograph, or a piece of furniture, but they soon realize that these items are irrelevant in The Blue. Everyone assumed memory would be a given (it is not — breath is the only default setting — and we're tired of reminding you people of this), and one day they wake, confused. Who are those people in the picture? What is a picture? How do I know this word? There is an upholstered chair in the corner, but you've elected not to keep your legs so what's the point? What use do you have for that shirt when a chest cavity becomes extraneous? When a stomach is left off the list? Because of this, we remind everyone during the intake session: Bring only what you need. Bring only that which is required to function. Over time you can win back the rest.May we remind you: 20 items. 20. Some ask: Where do the items go? We respond how we always respond: They are returned to The Deserving. How else would we be able to run The Blue? Measures are needed to protect you from one another, and those measures require resources, money. We exist to preserve life.Have you reviewed the contents of your Welcome Packet along with your New Identity Folder? You have been assigned an online identity, an avatar (we can make adjustments — we've found Photoshop to be useful), a social media presence (your starting point is determined by a number of factors including projected possibility of popularity, race, gender, age, and income), a set of interests, likes, and dislikes — personal preferences, if you will — and a library of rights-free images, fonts, popular vernacular, and emoticons. You'll enjoy monthly refreshes, and we can discuss your goals for personal growth during Quarterly Review.By now you've heard the rumors about the disproportionate allocation of audiences. Let me assure you that these aren't rumors, they're facts, and that's what makes the game interesting. If everyone were equal what fun would that be?There's a race, gender, and age hierarchy in your packet, but why bother reading what you already know. The good news is that The Blue can elevate your status. The challenges you complete and the points you accumulate will one day afford you the privilege of The Deserving. All the rules of engagement are detailed in your Packet. The goal is to be popular, be liked, and you do this by being what people wish they could be. Pictures and inspiring quotes only go so far — we merely give you the tools in the toolbox, it's up to you to build your kingdom. You might have heard about the success stories and know that with an increase in your social status you get special privileges. We attach badges to your avatar and you get to change your font size and color. People will know you're special.Cliques, groups, and fiefdoms are inevitable in The Blue because where there are thoughts and a means in which to express them (even in our strictly monitored and controlled environments), hierarchies will always exist. We encourage you to not engage in flamewars—only if it is to your strategic advancement. Nobody likes a troublemaker, and due to recent budget cuts, most of our community managers can't work overtime.The first thing we lost was our voice. It slipped away in stages.Next were the pictures in the frames. All gone. Then the children vanished, one by one. No one noticed at first. Some of the mothers couldn't cry out for help (no voice), so they were forced to scream their sorrow on paper. They wrote in all caps because this is still the easiest way to get someone's attention. The children were taken with their eyes half closed, in the space between sleep and awakening. We saw the flyers, the missing persons reports, and the websites showing the pictures that had been removed from the frames and a reward for the children's safe return. No one will ask questions, just give us back our children. Bring them home.One day we received printed notices sealed in white envelopes.We will give you back the children, but we require something in return.We posted signs on our window detailing the terms of our surrender. Back then we didn't know we were prolonging the inevitable — everyone is forced (or born) into The Blue. We were naïve, desperate. We would do anything to return to normal. So we read about a program that promised a rebirth. Imagine being born into a virtual world where pain ceased to exist. There would be no pestilence, famine, corruption, environmental catastrophe, or war. The whole of your life would exist within the confines of a seven-by-seven room — a virtual bunker that would shield us from the physicality of the natural world. The room would have no windows, only walls that served as screens. We pictured an existence free of Republicans, Christian fundamentalists, global warming, telemarketers, reality TV shows, eyeliner, stamps, parking tickets, kale, and junk mail.We were locked in a room for a trial period. Over the years, we experienced a gradual, careful loss. Items from our person were being removed, and we didn't register their loss until the next item vanished. You notice a nail gone when a whole thumb goes missing — that sort of thing. We never discuss the accumulations, even after the years following our release, because how could we? How could we explain the negligence that occurs when whole parts of our bodies vanished? How could we comprehend that we don't remember the children we spent 10 years in a room trying to reclaim? Was it worth it? When we were paraded out in front of our children to say our goodbyes, some parents blinked onto their screens: I'm sorry. Do you belong to me? I don't remember you. Why are you making this sacrifice? You hardly remember us.Later we learn that the children were told that we would say this. They were encouraged to nod politely and ignore us, as teenagers are prone to do.You're probably wondering why no one's crying. Simple — we don't mourn what we don't remember missing. Weeping feels futile when our emotions have been excised so cleanly and completely. We don't wonder where hearts originate.When we were released and labeled The Defective, our children were shuttled into our rooms to take our place. They were promised fully functioning parents, an all-expenses-paid reassembly, if they were to participate in the beta. The Deserving required additional observational data. We want clocks so we'll know when our time is up! The children's demands were indulged because they bordered on adolescence, and part of our job required this level of entertainment. The children didn't know about the vanishings — they didn't foresee the taxonomy of things they would slowly, inevitably lose. They were told their parents were an experiment gone wrong, an anomaly.No one tells the children where we end up. They don't see the advertisements regarding the opening of our exhibit. How the rooms they've now been locked in have been recreated in excruciating detail, and how we'll spend the rest of our days trapped in them. They don't hear the promises to The Deserving — we're doing this all for you!Everyone is led to believe that The Blue is a sanctuary. No one sees that The Deserving never receive Welcome Packets. They aren't invited to the Open Houses. No one accounts for the fact that The Deserving have bonfire parties where they laugh over the items that have been surrendered and discarded. In moments they snatch up the items that take months for The Defective to give away. We tell The Deserving to not be greedy, they are in the minority and there's enough to go around. New Defectives are born for The Blue every day.@nadia tries to jump out of a window, only there are no windows, only walls, and @nadia doesn't have legs or feet but that doesn't stop her from trying — not hard enough it seems. We see her cursor making a kicking motion. We watch her paint her blue room black out of protest. We record her not logging on for three days and two hours. During that time she processes forms to change her avatar to a photo of the dog she was forced to leave behind — a Pomeranian that sleeps with one of The Deserving at night. When there's a server outage, @nadia can sometimes see the photos posted by those on the Outside. The puppy she held in her hands now sleeps beside a little girl with red hair. @nadia knows this because the mother posts photos of her sleeping daughter online for everyone to see. It's an infraction to brag about redistributed items, and the mother will get fined at the most and receive a stern email at the very least, but in the end, @nadia blames herself because her dog was not one of the 20.On the fourth day she offers @mikey her badges in exchange for a window with a view — she's read about the infamous @mikey in the underground forums. But @mikey is a mole, a spy, a low-level agent of The Deserving, and he posts unflattering photos of @nadia as punishment for her infraction. @nadia unfollows people; she blocks them and joins a forum instructing people on how to delete. Burn your manual. We'll show you how to secure a dignified end.@nadia: Kevin, can you do me a favor and turn off the fucking cameras? Give a woman a little privacy, would you?Operator Kevin Gray: @nadia, you know I can't do that.@nadia: We all know about the budget cuts, the infighting on the Outside. There's no one around to monitor you. They're too busy fighting over the leftovers.Operator Kevin Gray: We've been keeping track…@nadia: There's no we; there's only you, Operator Kevin Gray. And last time I checked all your limbs were intact — you have the privilege of being a person, while I'm a screen name, a thing in a room with 20 objects down to 15. My memory was #13 of 20, and sometimes I wish I'd brought Lacy instead of that.Operator Kevin Gray: (sighs) You know they wouldn't have allowed a complete pet. Nothing living arrives intact. Love is what's abandoned because there aren't enough numbers to bring something as large as that in.@nadia: (photograph disappears; she starts the download) Stay with me while I delete.Operator Kevin Gray: Don't fuck this up. You've got a good setup here.@nadia: This is good? All I see is a prison with an internet connection. I lost an eye five minutes ago and I didn't even know it. Do you know what that's like? To live each day in fear of what will be missed?Operator Kevin Gray: You know I can't allow that. You know —@nadia: I know, what? That we're The Deserving's entertainment? That we're what they watch now that televisions have been taken away? That we'll never earn our way out — the badges, hearts, and numbers are a mountain of false hope. Operator Kevin Gray, we know. We know that we'll lose our 20 over time. We know that we'll be replaced and our fans redistributed and our hearts bled back to white. A lot of us have been afraid for a long time, and fear was the one emotion you forgot to modulate maybe because you suspected we would never figure you out. A lot of us know who you are, what we really are, and we're telling as many as we can. You forgot, Operator Kevin Gray. #18 was my intelligence. #19 was my dignity.Operator Kevin Gray admires @nadia so you have to know that he doesn't take the following events — the gas and the injections after — lightly. But he has a duty. Even though she's one of The Original's children, a girl who spends her life confined to four screens, a ceiling, and a floor, he has a purpose. Even though she forgets how heavy rain wrinkled her skin and how fireflies glowed hot in the night, he has a duty. Operator Kevin Gray wipes her browsing history clean and removes the photo of her puppy. When @nadia wakes the next morning she can't recall how she arrived at her room or why she has been placed there. She only knows that she's meant to turn on the computer and start accumulating. Nearly everything of hers has vanished, and she will never remember what she had and subsequently lost. She'll never realize that Operator Kevin Gray is watching, that in the middle of the night, he retrieved and returned one of her eyes.A week later we start making our withdrawals from Kevin. He goes willingly, of course. He never asks why because he knows. His duty was to take orders and his purpose was to follow them. Operator Kevin Gray was never supposed to feel anything for The Defective. He wasn't supposed to feel anything at all.What do you mean they're bored? We've got nearly the entire world population cut up and shut up in rooms and the children require additional amusements, further costume changes? Do you understand the sacrifices that have been made? The gods everyone had to forsake for The Deserving? There is no rewinding of the tape. Turning back is impossible.Let's dial down the dramatics. I'm just saying that some are concerned about the methods that have been employed against some of the dissidents. Others have suggested that we've taken The Blue too far…Now you have a conscience? Maybe you should have considered that before posting videos of your friends in The Defectives' houses, rummaging through their things, eating their food, and filling up your bodies with their organs.The past is past. Now we're wondering whether there's a middle ground, if there's something that we can give to appease them. Not enough for them to be dangerous, but something that allows them to be grateful. They trust you — the sites and forums your company built — you're their sole connection to what's in and beyond The Blue.More like appease you, but let's say I sell the story of hope to The Defective. What do I get in return?Your men get their overtime. And you get what you've always wanted. Recognition. Respect. Love.One morning, @nadia's Pomeranian attacks the little Deserving in her sleep. The parents call the hospital and are given a ticket number. We're in a war; a dog bite is considered low priority. Call us back when the dog mauls her and we'll bump her number up. Until then… When the father shouts, rattling off his title and rank of importance, the operator responds by blasting hold music. The daughter is bleeding, and the wife insists that she'll need a transfusion. Already the woman is cutting herself and bleeding into a mason jar just in case. She's adopted; she's not even our blood type, the father says. It would be just like you to remind me, the wife responds. Clearly your rank isn't that important.A week later, the little Deserving dies from infection, and in her grief the mother curls up next to the dog, dresses it, and calls it by the little girl's name. When the father kicks up a fuss, he's demoted and denied access to the country club. We're in the middle of a fucking war, the wife cries out. No one's playing golf. No one's asking for Glenfiddich on the rocks. I don't even understand why we're at war. Didn't we get rid of The Defectives? Everyone's the same — what's there left to fight about?And you wonder why your body wasn't built for children.The online publisher gets his overtime and a standalone show on all the premiere screens once the televisions become extinct, but one night he wakes in terror and writes on a piece of paper:This is what happens when you delete without a proper archive.Profiles and pages and photos and approvals deleted without burial. They work so hard to be one of the enviable and beloved. They spend days calibrating words and editing photos. They study and analyze the monthly data and trend reports and take fastidious notes during Quarterly Review. And yet we're deleting pages faster than we create new ones. We scrub down their rooms and incinerate any leftovers from the 20. The Defective are only known for the duration of their online existence while people write and publish books about the brave Deserving who are dying in droves.Some amongst us — the not so bright — contemplate enacting a draft, a grand act of patriotism on behalf of The Defective. We are at war and need reinforcements. The idea nearly becomes law with opposing sides ready to make their picks like a game of grade-school dodgeball, until we have to remind them that The Defective are no longer people. They've exchanged their actual hearts for virtual ones because what use did they have for a heart that pumped blood through a whole archipelago of organs that has now ceased to exist? They've been taught to take only that which they need in order to grow their fanbase and prove themselves worthy of someone's attention and love. Only then do they have a chance to recover what was discarded before entering The Blue. Some make their gains based on their situation. (Who wouldn't throw an old woman dying of cancer a Like or a team #followback? Who wouldn't give a toddler a repin, a retweet?) The new life and near dying have it easy while everyone in the middle has to work.In The Blue, you learn quickly that you have to earn your keep. That knowledge makes you stronger even when everyone on the Outside grows soft, complacent, comfortable, and weak.Some of The Deserving won't let this draft business go, and we nearly miss the screen showcasing The Defective who risked it all to bring in a kitten. It paid off because Pickles the Pink Kitten banked 70 million views on his how-to video series ""Dear Defective"" for those new to The Blue. Pickles' owner was one of the elusive few that managed to retrieve her hearing. Functioning ears! The day the rumor spread, The Defectives regrammed pictures of Pickles with the caption #goals. And we're missing the debut of the latest video because some Deserving with a donated Defective brain has a bright idea about drafting blinking cursors to do their dirty work.We are exasperated. What are you going to do? Book a conference room and have them tweet our enemies to death?You'd be surprised what an online mob can do to an offline life. Remember that sweet picture of the little girl and the Pomeranian and how it went viral? You know what happened to that girl? Dead. Everyone remembers the dead little girl and the puppy that takes her place. I heard the dog took off her face! Lies, all lies, it was only a flesh wound and a father who got a lousy ticket and hold music.Hold music. One says: I know how we'll conquer our enemies. Put them in The Blue with hold music. Everyone gasps. The Blue is a war crime. We might as well behead and waterboard while we're at it.Over the next year and during the war that would stretch for an additional 10, bodies begin to give out. Donated organs from The Defective become… defective. Houses collapse and furniture rots, mushrooms bloom from the insides of cushions and along the walls. Wallpaper peels and animals keel over. Land that was once fertile expels fumes. Flowers recoil and vegetables turn to ash. It's as if everything that has been taken from The Defective expires when they do.Sometimes people wake to see The Defectives' fingers under their doors or crawling up from the floorboards.Long after the books about The Deserving have been burned and everyone discusses the return of the abacus and Paleolithic diets, there exists a small community of young Blues who archive.We are the minority, and we're dying while The Defective replicate and reproduce online. We are dying and times are changing and our children, who remember the girl who got bit by the dog and the parents who did nothing, begin to realize that maybe we got it wrong. Maybe we're the ones who needed to be contained. Maybe those in the Blue are the beautiful ones — fragile, refined parts of a person trying to be a person, trying to live and project the very best of their sad and tragic life."
The Chamar’s Wife — A Short Story,"Chamar: widespread caste in northern India whose hereditary occupation is tanning leather; the name is derived from the Sanskrit word charmakara (""skin worker"").At first, I thought it was magic: the Earth suddenly crying. I thought I'd finally found something to make my father and I rich. A creature that cried like a human, one I could sell to the circus in the city. But it wasn't. It was just a baby. I didn't tell anyone. I left it there, crying and drowning in the dirt again. I was a few years older when I learned that many fathers here chose to bury their girls. It was old news — centuries-old — but it was still new to me. I must have wondered over a hundred times what had stopped my father from doing the same. I've never asked. I soon learned he doesn't do the same things as all the other fathers: he refuses to lower his head when the Thakurs talk back to him, he rarely pauses when he enters a sacred space not meant for us and he never accepts money from uncomfortable men even when he's got nothing but the clink of a few rupees in his shirt pocket.His defiance has become an annoyance.""Father, please. Do as they tell you."" I plead. The sun bleeds hard, consuming me with its severity.""Beta."" He rests his thumb on my chin. ""You're too young to understand and that's okay but please don't involve yourself in this.""Father, I don't think less of you.""""I know you don't but they do."" My father spits and it lands on the officer's polished shoe. The officer looks at the froth, his steady breath turns hard and heavy.""Get rid of these creatures. Clear the road!"" The officer's eyes refuse to meet my fathers.""No."" Father insists.The pack of bodies around us murmurs to themselves, the meek ones walk away. I stay because I'm his daughter.""You should listen to your daughter, old man. Instead, you are choosing to make the situation ugly.""""Do your worst. Today, I refuse to pick up carcasses. If you want them gone, you do it,"" my father replies.The officer looks down at his shoe. The froth has slid into the mud, revealing again the pristine leather that protects his feet. ""So be it,"" he says. He tells me to step aside.I've seen it happen before, so I let go of my father's forearm.The officer provides a hand signal to the two others behind him. As they approach us they shake off their lathis and begin hitting them against my father's brittle body. A series of white lines appear — flashes of lightning — as the wood bounces off brown skin. The lines become pink, and red spots begin to appear where the lathis have met the skin more than a few times. My father alternates from holding his lifeless palms together to ramming flying hands at my feet instructing me to stop watching. But all I can do is watch and teach myself not to do as my father does.Once the men realize my father is nothing more than a sack of sore skin, they walk off, leaving me to carry the burden back to our shack. The rice and milk father earns will soon be gone. What will we eat tomorrow? He brings problems to our door and I have to endure the consequences. I'm angry at him for making me think of my mother in such a way: only wishing she were alive so that she'd have to take responsibility for his actions. I know I should look after him but he makes it feel like a chore. If I don't have a problem with him picking up carcasses then why does he?I put my father down softly on the charpoy. He muffles a groan for my sake. It still hurts.""Try to rest. You've done enough for one day,"" I scold.He coughs as he tries to speak but still he persists. ""Beta, if I don't try to change our situation, it won't change.""""Why you, father? There are lots of other men in the village. Let them change things.""""Who? Who else is willing?"" He coughs again, this time with full force.I hand him the last pot of water. ""They won't listen to you. The policemen don't even look you in the eye.""""I don't want them to look at me. I need them to hear me.""""Well, they don't.""""Disobedience isn't respectful and disrespect is worse than death for them""""You keep disrespecting them and they'll keep beating you. Is that what you want?""""If it changes our — """"— You won't be able to change anything, father. No-one will ever swap jobs with us. Just look after yourself and do as you're told.""""I'm doing it for you.""""And I'm trying to look out for you.""""It's my job. I'm the parent."" He looks at me, opening his lips as if to say something but closes them again. He looks down at his blood-spotted bare feet. ""It's my duty,"" he says, softly.""You and your duty. Duty won't protect you, father.""""Beta, we are slaves, and slavery in every scope of the word is a sin.""""I don't want to know what is a sin and what's not. I've already lost my mother. The least you can do is look after yourself.""He doesn't respond. Instead, he turns his head toward the brick wall. He wants me to know he would like to rest. Although, he's far from resting. He may think he's perfected the art of silent weeping but I'm not oblivious to it. Again, I'm forced to think of my mother in a peevish mood. My father didn't have much to offer her but his integrity, except, I had always felt as though she too had wanted him to be like the other men in town. ""Suraj earns twice as much rice as we do just for cleaning the lavatories on time and I heard Anil earns money now,"" she'd tell him. I think her envy made him feel inadequate; ""I don't even get to shit in peace,"" he'd reply. He used to get called away mid-shit. Not that smell is something he'd have to worry about because our village is shit-scented. He used to tell her that's why Goddess Lakshmi doesn't call upon us. Said he tried his best to keep things clean but in doing that, it made him feel far dirtier. ""Standing up for oneself trumps asking Goddesses for Wealth,"" he'd mutter before going off to work. I think mother died from resentment as much as from having a fever.I sigh, deeply.""Father, you say you have to look after me, then…it must be my duty to do your job when you cannot. If I were a boy, you wouldn't refuse.""""You are not a boy."" He turns his head.""And, yet, look: hands and legs to do the job."" I shake my limbs in front of his face.""Listen to me. You're not strong. You cannot deal with that kind of weight.""""You manage.""""Don't get smart with me, child.""""Well, you can barely breathe. So, try and catch me.""As I run out into the mud-ridden street, I can hear my father cough and yell out: ""Akku, don't let them beat you. Akku. Akku!""The difference between dead birds and dead cattle, aside from the weight, is it's difficult to ignore the faces of larger animals. The calf I stand over has a bewildered look; death dared to consume it. The only consolation it had was to be considered divine. Whereas, no-one ever cared about the birds in the first place. Not that it's a problem. The real problem lies in moving the large creatures. I cannot think how to do it alone. I want to prove I can do the job. Prove to father that it wasn't in vain keeping me alive. I can be valuable instead of expensive. Except, it's far from easy. I can't drive a vehicle and if I'm spotted dragging it, I'll probably get accused of wanting to eat it. I don't want to be a menace like my father. I don't want to be beaten. I struggle to push the dead calf into the grass. I'll come back for you, I whisper, to nothing but flesh that ripens under the sun.The community farmer tells me he cannot financially afford to burn cows this month. He tells me to go and make a deal with the local Chamar. ""Tell him I sent you,"" he says, giving me directions. Twice. As though my visit would somehow benefit him too.The Chamar's place is a long walk; past the tin shanties of our neighborhood and the row of clumsy market stalls that squat in the center of the city. A little further from the smoky highway sits an introverted building in the middle of a large open field — as though it's hiding on purpose. As I get closer, a nauseating stench leads me to the perforated, brick-topped structure. It's housed behind an unlocked heavy-wooded gate that tries to test my strength as I push it open. I'm met with two doorways: one has a charpoy placed outside it. Heavy tan-colored fabrics sit on top. A mud-covered scooter lays on the floor, unloved.I walk through the other doorway. The tangy odor becomes so thick, I'm forced to hold my nostrils shut. Inside, a grey-haired, wrinkle-cheeked man rubs hard at the red on his yellow-stained vest. Fabric, the same as that outside (although not as shiny) lay beside his bare feet. Hardened white bits peek out from the sides of the fabric. Behind him stands another man: younger and emaciated. He sees me and taps the older guy on his shoulder, who upon noticing me, throws down the rag from his hands. ""Hey, get away. This is no place for a girl.""""What are you doing?"" I ask.""I told you once, get away from here.""""I was asked to come here.""""We are skinning dead cows! Happy?"" The younger guy pipes up.""Why?""""What, why? There is no why?. This is our job. Stop asking silly questions and go home."" The old guy says.""What are you going to do with them?""""Again, with the questions. Get lost, go on,"" he says. But after muttering something to himself, he walks off.The younger one, his son. The one who has been eyeing me as if I were his dinner, walks toward me.""Hey, why are you asking all these questions?"" He demands.""I want to know why your father is skinning the cows.""""Are you stupid? Do you not know where you are?""I let his commentary slide after reflecting upon it.""He makes money, you know. And he's not my father, he's my uncle. But I still get the business when he dies.""""How can you stand by and let him do this?""""Skin the cows?"" He smirks.""Do you kill them? You could get beaten, you know.""""People from Ahmedabad come to buy the hide. The bones and hooves go to merchants in Rajasthan. And…we take the meat. Happy?""""So, you ravage their entire body?""""Hey, it's our job.""Why do the men around me insist on reminding me they have a job to do?""They make pottery out of bones, you know. Not that you can afford it."" He runs his hand through his hair as if he were a Bollywood stud instead of a dusty-haired boy who pounces on dead meat.""That's disgusting,"" I say.""It's just bones.""""It's just bones."" The urge to mimic him creeps up on me like a swarm of mosquitoes after the rain.""Hey, know your place, girl. You can't speak to me like that.""The boy looks me in the eye and holds his stare. He knows I don't have anything more to say, and I've had enough of this sad place so I leave.I don't tell them about the dead calf.Father is asleep but he'll be up soon.I put the rice to cook on a fire outside the shack so the clatter doesn't wake him.When the dish is prepared, I call out to him.""Father.""""Father.""""Father! The rice is ready.""He doesn't respond.After my father's death, I took our possessions, along with my newly-found independence and laid them out in different parts of the town. The worst had happened and I no longer had no-one to worry about. I thought solitude would be liberating but it's overwhelming. So I've set up on a small patch of balding grass near a block of suburban flats. I like to observe the life of its female residents. Their daily routines bring me comfort. Although, their maidservants do most of the hard work. Every morning, their glass balconies are adorned with freshly-washed clothing: vibrant salwars and sarees, fancy undergarments and white shirts that hang beside different styles of school uniforms. Toward the top of the building, I can hardly make out whether the clothes belong to a girl or boy. I also get to speak with other women — of my kind, who go about tending to the communal gardens outside the flats. The building's white walls provide relief from the midday sun when I bathe. Sometimes, I notice the female residents watching me from their balconies. What pleasure they get I do not know. Perhaps, they wonder why I bathe outside. I'm sure they can see how small my shack is, it barely fits a charpoy and a few cooking utensils let alone space to freshen up. Still, I don't mind the women, it's when their husbands look that I wish I could crawl into myself. The wives are pretty, I can only imagine their butter-soft skin. Some wear gold necklaces that glide down the middle of the curves of their chest. Curves that look like they've been obtained from feasting on more than a healthy amount of food. The sight could make you believe goddesses lived on earth. Mother used to tell me I have a nice face. ""You have the perfect amount of space between your eyes that when it comes to marriage, no one will even notice your stick-thin form. Just stay away from those city men. They want nothing from you except your vagina."" Mother wouldn't be too pleased with my setup here.I don't pick up dead animals anymore. I didn't refuse. I just left it. Who's going to come and find me? No-one. Only the men get hassled to take such jobs. Lucky for me, the government doesn't care about me. Also lucky for me that my father kept my mother's old sewing kit. Only a few items remain now: a slightly-curved needle, black, red and white thread — the essentials, and a few bobbins. Not that I'd need them because they are no use without a machine. Father brought them for mother on what he thought was her birthday. Even my mother didn't know the date of her birthday. He'd promised that one day he'd buy her a sewing machine, a second-hand one, of course, but he'd buy her one nonetheless. It doesn't matter now. The threads I own are enough to make the money I need. The work comes in bits and pieces from the women who tend to the building. A little wear and tear don't bother them, it's only when the holes in their blouses reveal more flesh than they'd like that they are forced to have them mended. Once in a while, they'll bring around their husband's clothes; missing shirt buttons and unruly trouser hems. Small things that they can afford to get done. I'm sure they can do it themselves but they take pity on me. And I'm grateful because their clothing calamities are enough for me to buy myself some rice. The boy whose vegetable stall I pass on the way to buy the rice saves me leftover scraps of coriander and spinach. Gives them to me for free. When his father mans the stall, I come back with just the rice. Last week, the boy gave me a few tomatoes. I don't like tomatoes but I can hardly tell him that when he's kind enough to give them to me, so I threw them to the stray dogs when he wasn't looking.""Ey.""I look up to find a formal figure standing over me. He's a resident of the building, I recognize him because he's the only man who has a personal driver; one that picks him up in the morning and drops him home late in the evenings. Most of the men drive themselves. He wears a white band around his neck and a black gown which means he works for the government. What he does, I don't know.""Ey."" He snaps his fingers.Whoever he is, he's aware of his importance. ""What is it?"" I ask politely, hoping it might buy me mercy.""You need to move from here.""""But this isn't your land. That's your land. I point to the flats.""""Don't get smart with me, girl.""""But…I'm not a nuisance.""""Hey, just leave from here. Leave before I beat your ass.""He peels open his black gown and pulls out a white napkin from his trouser pocket. He shakes it out and walks to my shack. He lifts my utensils using the napkin as protection and starts to throw my belongings out onto the mud. Doesn't he know that I probably have more chances of catching his goodness than he does of catching my broken identity? The laying stray dogs rise from their resting positions.I decide to leave voluntarily before he beats me.""Leave my stuff. I'm going."" I tell him.""Good. Don't dare to come back,"" he says as he drops the napkin at my feet. The dogs bark at him. He tries to kick one from the group but it runs off. I shake off the white napkin and keep it. It's far from dirty. Leaving my possessions behind, I head to the Chamar's place.Even though I haven't been here since my father died, the place feels familiar. Even the stench of cattle death reminds me of him. I wait at the heavy gate feeling it's weight in my chest. I want to go in but my father's voice won't leave my ears. ‘Never take decisions based on the wrong motive.' I have to reassure the voice that what I'm about to do is precautionary, not careless. Surely even my dead father would understand, this is not a matter of morality but one of survival. And with that thought, I step inside.""What are you doing here? This time of night,"" the boy says, rubbing his eyes. He keeps looking back to make sure he doesn't wake his uncle who is sleeping on the floor a few feet away from the drying cow skins.""I have something to ask you,"" I tell him.""Then ask.""""Why were you staring at me when I first came?""""What else am I supposed to do?""""Well, does it mean you might like me?""He grins. ""I might,"" he says.""Then…Do you want to marry me?""""You can't ask, you're a girl.""""And?""""You have no father, you have no dowry.""""How do you know about my father?""""Your father used to come here long before you, now he's stopped coming. He's either dead, or he's skipped town.""""He's dead.""""Fine. I'll marry you if you skin my cows.""My heart climbs its way to my throat as if it were trying to warn me of a decision I would soon regret. I'm not being forced or ordered. Why does it need reassurance? It's my choice. I have the choice to be a woman and not an orphan. I can have company instead of roaming these streets alone. I can have a roof over my head instead of being kicked out of one. It's not like this house is any bigger than mine but it's stable, even with its hole-ridden exterior.""Fine."" I hold my clammy hand out for him to shake.""Put your hand away and kiss me."" He gathers his lips.""No."" I shriek, as if this request was somehow worse than his previous one.""Hey, this is not a business deal. You're not a vendor. You're asking to be my wife. You do understand what a wife's duties are, don't you?""""Yes, I do."" I say it with authority because I don't want him to think I'm a silly little girl. I move forward and kiss him on the lips as he'd asked.He smiles, as though he'd been blessed with something he's never prayed for.It's been six months since our wedding; a small affair: Manoj, me, his uncle and his uncle's girlfriend — he had a few but this one was brave enough to be seen with him in public. Not that anyone would have recognized her because the ceremony had taken place in the next town. The girlfriend: Sheetal, was more than happy to help me get ready. She told me it was the first time Manoj's uncle had invited her to a family function. She said it was a sign that their relationship could also end in marriage. Whatever the reason, I was happy to have female company. Plus, Sheetal had brought make-up with her. It was all half-used stuff. She had either found it in the scraps or stolen it from somebody's home. I had a feeling it was stolen. She seems like the sort of lady who could pull off a robbery, one with a daring look in her eyes — the look of someone who tested her capabilities. Manoj's uncle had also instructed Sheetal to go and pick up an outfit for me. The saree was an explosion of crimson with burnt gold embroidery; the prettiest piece of clothing I have worn in my life. We sold it after the ceremony. I would have liked to keep it but Manoj said we need the money more than we need an attachment to memories. ""You want to eat life when all we taste is death,"" he'd repeated. Sometimes, I think he awaits the liberation of death just so he'll be free from having to decipher his existence. Unlike father, he has no desire to fight. Not that he has to fight much. These days, he roams around town a lot more than usual. Mostly, he is out with Sheetal. After his uncle died the two of them became close. They drink a lot when they are together because I can smell it on his breath and his clothes. The first time he came home drunk I told him I didn't like it and that he shouldn't do it again. I told him how my father never drank. Father said that men who had troubles shouldn't drink because every glass will add more trouble and subtract none. Father never had a death wish either — at least not from alcohol. It's dangerous in a dry state like ours. Who knows where it comes from or how it's made, especially for people like us. Manoj didn't appreciate me looking out for him because he told me to stay out of his business. ""You're lucky you were born a girl, otherwise you'd get a slap,"" he'd said. I didn't push him on the topic again.I focused my efforts on getting better at skinning. The trick lies in a sharp knife and steady hands. Although, my hands are never steady anymore. The knife helps pull the skin away from the muscle and bone. The skin becomes rough after the animal is dead. Since becoming pregnant, though, the smell has become unbearable. The oils and salts do not carry distinct scents anymore; they have merged together, with the further smell of sour meat. I dare not close my eyes when I'm working, I'm afraid to wake up in something worse than an apocalyptic warehouse. But the leather brings us money — for now, at least. Manoj says the government will soon stop us from skinning for leather. They want to make sure the reputable tanneries in Chennai take care of it. Manoj is furious. I'm glad. The few times I've asked him if he can do the skinning he reminds me that I came with no dowry. Sometimes, I get into a rage and the only solace I can offer myself is to spit in his tea but I soon regret it. After all, he gave me somewhere to call home. Ingratitude would be a sin.As usual, Manoj rushes in and sits down cross-legged. Ready to be fed.""Give me something to eat.""""I'm just finishing up,"" I tell him.""Well, hurry it along. I'm hungry.""My heart beats the fastest when he sits for dinner because my cooking abilities fail to meet the urgency of his hunger.""It's ready,"" I assure him.As I take the rice off the heat I learn that I have picked the pot up with my fingers. I slam it down. Beads of rice bounce and land on the floor. I scoop up the white blobs and place them in the dish with the tea and pickle. I catch Manoj watching me. He's angry. I know it's not because I've put dirty rice on his plate — we can't afford wastage. He's angry because of the bursts of stupidity I've been displaying lately. How do I explain to him the pregnancy is making me forgetful when he struggles to understand why my morning sickness interferes with the job of skinning.I hand him his food.He hands me a paper parcel that he kept hidden behind his back. ""Take"". He shoves the parcel at me.""What's it?"" I ask.He doesn't say and begins eating. Fingers deep inside his mouth.I unwrap the newspaper. It holds a crumbled-apart piece of laddu.""Sheetal told me to give it to you. Because…"" He looks at my stomach as if he weren't a part of what we'd made. ""…You are pregnant.""""Sheetal sent? You didn't think to buy?""""What difference does it make? You got extra food today. You should be happy.""""I am happy.""""Let me eat in peace.""We eat in silence. Not that I'm complaining, this is my life. Slightly altered but the same. It's not the same as my parents' evenings, of course. Mother loved to talk a lot and Father never asked her to stop. He listened to her stories so that he'd have someone to listen to him. They exchanged conversation which often led to arguments. The arguments were hardly bitter even though the talk was not all sweet. They are the reason I like to talk, but no-one likes to talk to me. Not unless they want to tell me what to do. Manoj doesn't have any stories. If he does, he chooses to tell Sheetal them instead. He'll probably tell her how I got offended because she sent food. She'll laugh but understand why another woman chooses to dislike her. Then she'll comfort him in ways I cannot. It's not funny but I giggle because he's clumsy in the bedroom. A boy trying to imitate a man. I don't have anyone to compare him to but she will. Manoj looks at me, his thick eyebrows turned up out of irritation rather than curiosity. ""It's nothing,"" I tell him. He continues with his dinner. Suddenly I realize marriage hasn't made a woman out of me, it's just stripped me of the naivety I possessed. Maybe that's what it means to be a woman.I have a recurring dream: my mother hovers over my body, as ghosts do. I'm always in labor. It's going to be a girl. ""You've put on weight everywhere"", she tells me. ""I don't want it to be a girl"", I say. ""How do I raise her how a girl is supposed to be raised? Help me, ma,"" I cry out, but every time, she ignores me.In last night's dream, my mother laughed hard at me before morphing into Manoj. He was shouting at me: It's a girl. It's a girl. You stupid woman. We cannot have her. He snatched her by her legs as if she were made of rubber; unable to be broken. He threw the baby to Sheetal who let her fall on the floor. She wasn't Sheetal anymore. She was a wild predator who sank her teeth into the plastic doll that lay under her. I let no more tears fall; I'd given birth to a doll, not a baby, what use was it? The animal shot me a look with its piercing black eyeballs, smug, as if they saw something I didn't. As if the doll would bring the creature sudden prosperity.I wipe sweat the dream left off my forehead and chin with the corner of my saree but the fabric is slippery and leaves a sticky film of wetness over my face. Manoj is sleeping on the floor beside me, breathing heavily through his mouth. He doesn't have the best of profiles, his prominent nose makes his small chin appear nonexistent. I wonder what Sheetal sees in him. Is she the reason he hasn't taken an interest in this baby? It's been so long I can't remember his reaction to hearing I was pregnant. I try to recall it but it doesn't come. But you remember people being happy, don't you? Manoj has never been happy. I place both hands over my bump. What if you're a girl, I whisper to it. If your father is anything like the Manoj I dreamt about, he'll probably bury you where the cattle bones are kept or he'll ask Sheetal to sell you. God knows we need the money more than we need the attachment to unwanted babies, he'd say. And what will your mother do when your father is getting rid of you? I whisper again. The women my mother knew held their stomachs up and carried on with their days, tending to the cooking and cleaning, frantically erasing the nine months gone. Not long after, they'd be pregnant again. They'd ask my mother to pray for them: Pray for a boy. What use was that when her own prayers hadn't worked. Most had girls again that would soon disappear. The mothers would too if they had a girl three times in a row. I don't want anyone to pray for me. Whoever is inside, it's mine. There's nothing else in this world I can call mine. I'm disposed to it. But does it trump the duty I have towards my husband? Without an elder present, I have no-one to ask. No-one to confide in. Perhaps I should be glad. There are elders who offer ill-intentioned advice. Mothers who side with their son's choices, no matter how gruesome. I've heard stories.I sigh.The duty I've been fulfilling as a wife feels airless and violent. It feels different to the duty my father had shown toward me. Even though it was filled with pain it seemed as though his rebellion had inflicted some satisfaction that couldn't be understood.A pang of remorse — or maybe desperation, finds me. Question upon question fills my head: where will I go? How will I live? What if it's a boy; do I need to go? What if it's a girl? Will Manoj care? Despite them, I scan the room for a clue to where Manoj keeps all the cash, but he shuffles and begins to peel open his eyes, as though he knows what's going through my head. I let the idea evaporate as I lay back down. I cover my belly with my saree. I arrive at the conclusion that Manoj wouldn't care that I've gone, just that I've taken the money."
This Thing of Timing,"The night we met, I kept wandering into the darkest corners of the bar to check my phone behind your back.The night we met, I slipped outside with the smokers and kissed someone else while you weren't looking. Or perhaps you caught a glimpse of it, I never asked.Yet, the night we met, I left that dark, crowded bar with you.At first, it felt to me like a compromise. Like it was still too early, and I was too tipsy to go home alone, to not have the night I had set out to have. But as soon as you held me, as far away from another living soul as we managed to get, I knew I had made the right choice.After we kissed, I went to bed as giddy as a teenager in love.No, I wasn't in love. I was in lust. I lusted for your embrace and your kiss and how much I thought we had in common and, finally, someone I could talk to. Someone who didn't bore me to tears, who sounded enthusiastic about life, and who seemed genuinely happy to see me.I was horny for how well I thought we got along.Except it seemed like we got along only until we didn't. Until it became painfully clear your schedule didn't match my needs; and my immediate dreams were in direct conflict with your long-term goals.Until it became clear that, had we met at some other point in life, we'd be perfect together.Not good, not great, perfect.You made me see bad timing for what it was: a trick of fate.You made me see it for the painful wake-up call that is it: the one that tells you chemistry is not enough, and that two people can have the same overall dreams, but a very different understanding of how to go about achieving them.Two people can have the same destination in mind, but a different idea of what's an appropriate pace to get there — and which detours are reasonable to make along the way.And then you said I smothered you. I made you feel trapped, which to me was code for, ""I can't do this — right now.""So you walked away to go do what you had to do, and I distracted myself texting and kissing other boys in dark bars and back alleys in between cigarette breaks.I had given you up until it seemed, for a fleeting moment, that we were possible again.You texted ""hi."" I texted ""hi"" back, and it took everything I had to keep everything else from spilling right out.You were doing fine, and so was I.You were still you, and I was still me, and we still had all those things in common that had brought us together to begin with, the only difference was time.Time had passed, our situations had changed. The ever elusive timing seemed like it might just be on our side. Barely. One wrong move and it would slip away, forever beyond our reach.And then the world shut down on us, and it placed what it feels like thousands of miles between you and I.I used to fear what I might say next, now I fear saying anything at all.I fear this is definitely not the time to restart something that was so fragile the first time around. I'm afraid to rekindle a flame that can't survive this storm. Now is not the right time for us. Again.This thing of timing. It might have won us over, at last."
Kaleidoscope Girl,"I bought a mobile home ‘cause I was recovering from heartbreak. That's what I said, anyway. Because there were questions, you know. Not very common to see a 20-year-old single gal move into a mobile home park. It was a tight-knit crew at Eden Springs Mobile Home Community and they were rather nosey. I would tell one thing to Cheryl from Unit #27 and Louisa from Unit #44 would casually ask me about that very same thing. So I was light with the detail, heavy on the ""yes ma'am"" and ""no ma'am"" and I had my signature line ""recovering from heartbreak"" that I could use when they were really prying.It wasn't the normal kind of heartbreak, at least the ones Cheryl, Louisa, and Mari were familiar with, anyway. But calling things different names didn't make it hurt any less.It had to be hard, loving someone like me. I was an amalgamation of sitcoms my Nana used to watch, songs I heard on the radio and lines other people told me that sounded nice enough to repeat. I was a kaleidoscope of references I couldn't place and opinions that didn't belong to me. I had no fixed personality or preferences of my own, so I reflected those around me.That's why I felt for Travis, because it had to be hard, loving someone who wasn't a real person at all. He had to be content with forever being my #2. Because no matter how many summer afternoons he and I spent kissing on the couch, no matter how many times he would grin down at me that I was his very favorite girl, no matter how many days he worked on cars to provide for me, it was never really about him.It used to be so fun.It was Fourth of Julys and bottles of Jim Bean being passed in the back of pickup trucks. It was running from car to car at the drive-in with brown bags and drinking until dawn with all of my friends in the Motel 6. It was the first sip of white wine in the summertime down by the lake and drunk kissing behind a tree. It was pouring vodka into water bottles with my gal pal Charlie to bring to school and giggling all through geometry.Charlie and I thought we were hot shit because we could spit back the rhetoric the older guys we drank with had told us about how school was devised to combat our original thoughts and turn us into cogs in the machine. But Charlie and I really didn't have any original thoughts of our own. We had submerged them in so much Burnett's they didn't have a fighting chance to emerge. So we repeated their thoughts and we thought we were cool for it.And we were. Cool, that is. No one else in our grade was drinking with the older boys, riding around in Mustangs, raising hell all around Savannah. They picked us and we were special for it.I don't remember ever deciding to be with Travis. I was wasted, he was interested in me and he was old enough to get me any kind of alcohol I liked, so I let him press his lips to mine. He was a mechanic and he had a car, which was mighty impressive when I was 15. Best of all, he was in love with me, so he would do anything for me.Charlie went away to school once we graduated, which I thought was just the silliest damn thing I ever heard. All that talk we were always spitting out about how school is an establishment designed to entrap us and here she was, all chipper in her Georgia State gear, all jazzed up for rush week.""Charlie, promise me,"" I asked her while we were drinking by the riverbank with the boys for her going away party, ""Promise it'll be just like it is now when you come back to visit?""""It will be, I swear it"" she giggled, that signature toothy Charlie laugh I loved so much. It was the soundtrack to the best memories of my life, ""We're always going to be best friends. I promise.""We pinky-promised while the boys shot fireworks into the sky. I embraced her while they popped above us into the inky night and the boys howled at the moon.I really thought it would all be the same when she came back, with the Motel 6 parties, the brown bags, and the mischief.It was different the next summer, though. She was different. She had all of these stories and all of these new friends. She was taking online classes. Her hair was straightened from the brown mop of curly brown hair she used to let run wild. She would stop drinking every night by 11pm to make sure she was in the right frame of mind for studying the next morning.And she asked me questions about me, which was the worst part.""What about you?"" she asked when she picked me up in her Buick to go meet up with the guys at the drive-in, ""What have you been up to?""I shrugged, ""Y' know. Drinking. With Travis. Figuring it out.""There was something in her eyes I couldn't figure out. She had her sorority, her passion for nursing, her preppy friends, her frat boyfriend. I was a nothing girl, no stories beyond the ones I saw on television, nothing to show for the past year besides a hell of a lot of empty bottles. I wanted to plead with her, to ask her why she would leave me, why didn't she tell me we were supposed to move on with our lives? We had made a pinky promise, didn't that mean anything?But rather than say anything of the sort, I just drank myself into darkness and I was told by Travis later, I screamed at her about how she forgot me. These screaming fits were becoming more and more common when I drank, spitting venom at whoever was in front of me just like my mama used to do.That was the last night I saw her.When Charlie moved to Atlanta, I moved in with Travis to his condo in Pooler, which was about 10 minutes from where I lived with Nana in Savannah. He was a mechanic, a mighty good one too. He could just put his hands on a vehicle and know what the hell was wrong with it. With women, he didn't exactly have the same ability. When it came to putting his hands on my body, that is.I loved living with him anyway, because he didn't ever ask me to figure it out. He let me drink all day to watch television programs and listen to records. He let me talk nonsense to him when I was wasted about how the clouds looked like the color lilac, when he knew very well they were just grey. He would nod when I told him about my dreams of becoming an actress. When you're drinking, you can turn grey clouds into lavender, a day watching television into an adventure and a girl into an actress. He was fine with letting me live in my dream world, so long as I was there when he got home from work and I still grinned up at him, his girl, his sanctuary after dealing with the long, hard days of his work.I wasn't a complete piece of shit, okay. I cleaned, I grocery shopped for the two of us, I cooked him dinner every day. I called my Nana every afternoon. I had a glass of Jim Beam waiting for him once he returned every night, exhausted and covered in grease. I sat on his lap while we watched television and I tousled his hair with my fingers. We were dirt broke but we had each other, we had a television that worked most of the time, the oven was out but the stovetop worked just fine. We cuddled on the couch we bought at a yard sale at the side of the road. He didn't tell me what the money was really like, but he always managed to pass me two twenties to get the groceries and the alcohol for the week on Fridays with my fake ID. He didn't ask me to get a job or to limit my drinking. So it suited me just fine.And that was it — we had drinking. Doesn't matter where you are if you're drinking. Our little universe, with game shows, records, dreams that would never come true and Jim Beam, made us feel like we were royalty. Weekends we would drink by the river or set fireworks in the fields with his friends, bottles in hand and electricity through our veins.I used to think we could be anywhere, we could get through anything if we just had each other. I now think it's just cause we had booze.I dunno when exactly I realized I was in love with alcohol. I loved Travis, our little home and our little life.But I loved drinking so much more. It was my real first love. Pressing my lips to the bottle was the truest form of home I've found. I got butterflies every Friday when Travis left out $40 bucks and I could go buy more alcohol with my fake ID. Drinking, I felt more confident, more sure of myself, more like a real person than just a combination of sitcoms I half-heard and lyrics I remembered incorrectly. You're telling me something that makes you feel more like yourself isn't true love?All I knew is I began to love drinking more than I loved anything in my life and it was the only thing I ever felt like doing. I got increasingly anxious waiting for Travis to get home so I could pour us glasses and get back to the living, until I just started drinking before he got home.Nana could hear the inebriation in my voice for our 2pm balcony calls, I'm sure of it. Both of her daughters had gone down this path and I'm sure it broke her heart to see me fall in love myself.I knew I had a problem on my 20th birthday. I drank because I was nervous that Charlie would call to wish me a happy birthday, or maybe it was because I was even more scared she would forget. By 11am I was shitfaced, stumbling down the hallway singing happy birthday to myself. I laughed when I realized it. Houston, we've got a problem. It struck me incredibly funny to have an alcohol problem when I was still below the legal age of drinking in this country. So I giggled and drank, giggled and drank, and I was passed out by the time Travis got back from work.When I got the call Nana passed away, I was wasted. I tried to remember the last time she and I had talked and the last conversation we had. I tried to remember the last time I had Travis drive me out to see her. I couldn't grasp anything firm, it was so waterlogged in all of the boozey memories.It made me feel so helpless, like that last night I saw Charlie. I wanted to scream at Nana — why didn't you tell me you were going to die? Why didn't you tell me you were getting older?But hell, maybe she did. I couldn't remember the last damn conversation we had. Her last thought here on planet Earth must have been the disappointment that I was going the same path as her daughter, my mama. That she failed as a mother twice, losing both of her daughters to alcoholism then taking in her granddaughter who was seduced by the very same demon. Watching me fall in love with Jim Beam and partying just like her daughters did. Wondering if her years in rearing me and loving me when my mom wasn't able to was a waste.It took some time, some legal matters and family disputes, but it was decided I was getting some money from Nana's estate, which I didn't know she even had one. I grew up thinking we were dirt poor, but Nana was actually fairly smart with money, squirreling it away. She taught me you could live on bread and oranges while you're waiting on social security. Her mama had lived through the depression so I guess she was good like that.When my check came in the mail at Travis', I was terrified. I had never had that kind of money in my life. I didn't even have a bank account to cash that big ass six-digit number into. But once I learned how to turn that paper to cash, all I could think about is how many damn bottles I could buy with it. I dreamed of getting so obliterated that I could jut suspend myself in that perfect abyss of nothingness.And y'know, that's honestly how I planned on spending it. I didn't have to wait for Fridays when Travis handed me money for the groceries and the drinking anymore. I could buy my own bottles, each day of the week if I wanted to. I could drink as much as I wanted to.But since Auntie Margaret got Nana's house, I knew she was going to drink in that damn house until she died. I could just picture Nana's frown looking down from heaven. And this check, plus the butterfly mobile I swiped from the house I grew up in, were the last parts of my Nana I had.And I missed her. The only useful memories I could pull out of my television static of a brain were the memories we had when I was much younger. When I was five and she took me to the ice cream parlor the first night I moved in to let me know that my Mama was going away for a while to straighten herself out. When I was 8, when she took me to the fair, bought me cotton candy and took care of me when I threw it all up from the Tilt-a-whirl. When I was 12, when I got my period at school, and she picked me up to wipe my tears and take me to the drug store to tell me what was what. She threw in chocolate and a face mask in with the pads as an extra treat.Since I met alcohol, sure, she and I had talked every afternoon, but there was nothing to grab onto. It was last the last three years of my life, nothing significant. Just hazy blurs things that feel like they're funny but you never remember in the morning. Ideas that evaporate into nothingness. Mornings that are tinged with dread. And now I had no idea what exactly her stories were, what her legacy was, what her life was. And it was too late.That's the trouble with drinking. You don't know how much life you're missing out on.I hadn't the damnedest idea of what to do with the money besides drink. Go to college as Charlie did? What would I study? What was I good at besides drinking and watching television?Paying rent on a new apartment scared me too. It wasn't a lot in Pooler and that left too much money in my hands for reckless behavior. I wasn't to be trusted. The responsible thing to do would be to give it to Travis, probably, but then he would just hand me that $40 every Friday. I would stay with Travis because he bought the alcohol and he would keep buying me alcohol so I would stay.My only remaining decision, in my head at least, was to buy something big, all at once so I wouldn't have direct access to it and I wouldn't spend it on alcohol. So I bought a trailer home in Eden, bout 20 minutes from Savannah. Garden of Eden, I thought to myself. Paradise. I think I heard that in one of Nana's television shows.After buying the canary yellow mobile home and the lot, I still had some leftover, to cover me a couple of months for the $150 lot fee and the groceries. I had to be strict, though, because it wasn't much, but Nana had taught me how to get by close to nothing. I left Travis in the middle of the night and took the bus with a duffel bag of my clothes. I kissed him on the cheek but the saddest part was my last sip of Jim Beam.Life was different here in Eden Springs. I couldn't afford a television so all I could do for entertainment was read the bible the previous owner Larry left in the closet of my canary yellow trailer. I liked to sit on the patio to watch Nana's butterfly mobile dance in the wind, casting sunbeams like disco lights all over. I liked to walk to 7/11 to buy a hot dog and a slurpee every Friday afternoon.I woke up most mornings at dawn at Eden Springs mobile home park. I had bad anxiety from quitting the alcohol cold-turkey — anxiety that shot me out of bed, heart racing. I began to love the mornings I felt sleepy because I got so sick of springing out of bed as though I was on fire. It was such a hectic way to start a day of doing nothing at all and I could never get back to sleep.I thought about taking up smoking just to have something to do with all of the nervous energy I had cooped up in the body, but I was too broke for that. So in the mornings I woke up in a panic, I would sit on my patio and wait for the sun to come up, singing to the radio softly so I wouldn't feel so alone.That's how I got to see my neighbor Howie, 'cause he was always heading off to work at that time. Whistling, this guy, at like 5am, like there was anything to be cheerful about at that hour. Then he would always tip his hat to me and say good mornin' as though a bleary-eyed 20-year-old gal was just the most normal thing in the world to see on s scoop of a motor home in Eden, Georgia. After a couple of times of these silent exchanges, I asked him how he was and he always said ""better than I deserve.""I don't know what he had done to not deserve to feel good. He seemed like a nice fellow. If I thought about it, I knew I didn't deserve to feel good — neglectful granddaughter, shit girlfriend, alcoholic by 20 years of age. I deserved eternal damnation for all of that. So maybe I was doing better than I deserved too, with my empty days in the hot mobile home, watching my butterfly mobile spin in the breeze, singing along to the radio and reading passages from the bible to feel closer to my Nana.I had been doing nothing when I lived with Travis too, so I was awfully good at it, but this sort of nothing felt different. It felt so much more still without the alcohol. There was so much more time in the day. There was so much more space in my brain. It had taken up the largest part of my days since I was 14 years old, and without it, I just felt so empty. My heart ached for it, the confidence, the happiness, the joy it brought me.The anxiety and the heartache made me want to drink until I couldn't see. I wanted to every damn day. I dreamt about it, visualized myself drinking in the trailer park until I just croaked and I could just be suspended in nothingness.But I didn't want Howie or Cheryl or my next-trailer neighbor Mari to find me. They didn't deserve that. And my Nana, looking down at me and my canary yellow trailer, certainly didn't deserve that.The first thing I noticed about my next-door neighbor Mari were her nails. The trailers were awfully close to one another, so when she watched television, she would drape her cigarette out of the window, bout a foot away from my patio. She had the most glamorous nails with her cigarette placed in between, pink tiger stripes with palm trees on them, diamonds on her thumbs that caught the sunlight on her thumbs. Then two weeks later, I saw her nails had alternating lavender and celery green nails with little easter eggs on 'em for Easter. I didn't even realize it was Easter.It gave me something to look forward to, week after week that blisteringly hot spring and summer when all I could afford to eat was bread and oranges — well, what's Mari's nails going to look like this week?""I like your nails,"" I told her when she caught me looking at her latest creation, the white butterflies on a hot pink background, ""They're always so pretty.""""Thank you,"" she exhaled her smoke, ""I'm a hairdresser, so I figure, if I'm gonna have my hands on your head, they might as well be pretty.""""Makes sense.""""Y'know, hat mobile always catches my attention,"" Mari said, pointing up at Nana's butterfly mobile with her long pink nails, ""The light goes all over.""I blushed. When the wind picked up, that mobile spun so fast it shot sunbeams all over it would nearly make your eyes roll trying to follow it.""Does it bother you? I can take it down.""""Not at all,"" she grinned at me, with a little bit of lipstick on her teeth, ""Don't you dare. It just is funny to me, is all. This mysterious girl who don't say much has damn near a disco ball on her front porch. I can't tell if you want attention or you don't.""I smiled back at her, ""It was my Nana's. She loved butterflies.""""That's the name of my salon,"" Mari said, ""Monarch Beauty, you seen it? Just down the street on Montgomery Avenue. You oughta come by for a trim, I can spot those split ends from here.""I ran my hands through my long light brown hair self-consciously. Nana used to take me for my haircuts. When was the last time I got my hair trimmed? I couldn't even remember.I told Mari I would love that but I was broke as all hell. She told me not to worry, we could work something out.I didn't know what that meant exactly but I took her up on it a couple of weeks later because I didn't have anything else to do. It felt so comforting to see the faded butterflies painted all over her salon, to get wrapped up in a black smock like an embrace and to have her long nails work through my hair.""You mind if I put a little color in it?"" she asked me as she shampooed her long nails (bumblebees today) through it.""I'm your doll,"" I told her, ""Whatever you want.""She hummed to the Fleetwood Mac pumping over the speakers as she mixed the colors. My heart sped up as I imagined what she could do. Maybe when she turned me around in that black apron, I could finally look like myself. Feel like myself. Talk like myself. Whatever ""myself"" was.She spun me around and it took my breath away. I had long hair since I was a girl and now it was to my shoulders, with golden highlights caressing my light brown hair. My eyes looked a little bit brighter, the dimples in my cheeks looked a little more pronounced, I felt a little more sure.I couldn't even form words. I just sobbed.Mari and I worked out a deal where I would be the receptionist for her salon, fixing all of the hairdressers and manicurists' schedules when folks called or walked in. I loved being there, hearing all of the gals gossip about Eden's drama. I liked seeing those faded butterflies painted all around the salon. I liked remembering going with my Nana to her salon in Savannah every other Thursday when I was young. The smell of the chemicals and the nail polish brought me right back to those times waiting on Nana, listening to my grandma banter with the hairdresser she had for decades, Sue and seeing how much she sparkled when she left with a brand new perm.I was so captivated with the Georgia beauty queens who strolled into Monarch Beauty on Montgomery Avenue. They just seemed so glamorous, so sure of themselves, so content to spend their afternoons being meticulously groomed to become a more beautiful version of themselves.Mari paid me $450 a month to be the receptionist four days a week and threw in a free cut and color every month. We experimented with layers, going lighter, going darker, just trying to figure out when I would reach that color where I could look at the mirror and say yes. This is who I am. This is my final form.""Whaddaya think about auburn, Miss Lily?"" she asked me, running her (polka dot) nails through my hair after my shift one September afternoon.""I'm open to it,"" I told her, ""You think it'll fit me?""""We won't know until we tried it.""""Mari?"" I asked her as she leaned my head back into the water basin, ""Will there ever be a time that I've found the right hair color? The one that is just like — yes. This is who I am.""""Takes some experimenting to get there, sweets,"" she said while working her long, glamorous nails through my scalp, ""None of us have it really figured out. Even at my age. Try auburn while you're still young. It takes trying 'em all out until you know which colors are yours""I was redefining love. It was no longer when he fixed my drink just right. It wasn't the jitters and butterflies I got in my tummy when I walked to the supermarket on Friday afternoon. It was no longer the anticipation before my lips made the first kiss to the glass.It was when Mari and the other hairdressers would call me sugar and when our regulars would come in all excited about her upcoming date on Friday night. It was the consistency I could count on from Howie to give me a wave and a smile when I was up at dawn for no reason. It was the times I talked to my Nana on my walks to 7–11 for a Slurpee and a hot dog and spotted a butterfly, feeling more connected to her than ever.I was redefining fun. It was no longer drinking on the couch watching television. It was no longer setting fireworks, sneaking into dive bars, raising hell all around town just to feel alive. It was no longer laughing at those things that never strike you as just as funny the next day.It was now answering calls at the salon and finding just the perfect time to fit the clients in. It was the thrill of turning around in the chair for my monthly cut and color to see what version of myself I saw that day. It was seeing what wacky nails Mari was going to have for her two-week fill.I was redefining me. I was still a kaleidoscope girl, spitting out the sights and the fractals and the sound bites I picked up from the world around me, but I felt like I was getting closer every day, figuring out which colors were mine. I had my butterfly mobile, my sack of oranges and loaves of bread, my radio that played the songs I sang along to, my little canary yellow mobile home. My little life here, empty without the alcohol, but peaceful all of the same.And I had something else, something that felt like pride. I had survived heartbreak from the most devastating love of my life, alcohol. And my heart still tinged with nostalgia when the girls asked me to go to the bar after their final clients at Monarch or when I saw Cheryl bring home wine coolers to her trailer. But I don't think first love fades that quick, so I'll be gentle on myself on that.I had so much here at Eden Springs, which many would say wasn't much at all. It felt like a lot to me. The rest — the goals, the personality, that perfect hairdo that just encapsulated who I was — would come eventually. I was sure of it."
Remember Quarantine?,"That was tough, huh? At first, no one took it seriously. And then it came our way. Governments worldwide announced unprecedented measures: the obligation for everyone to remain confined to their home for several weeks.We were used to going wherever we wanted, whenever we wanted, as free people that we are. Suddenly, we had to reinvent our lives. Reinvent ourselves.It's been a long few weeks. We couldn't see the end of it. We missed our loved ones terribly. We missed our friends. We missed going out for a walk. Even going grocery shopping.We waited. The first week, we named them. Day 1. Day 2. Day 3. Day 7. Soon, we lost count.Then, as astonishing as it may seem, when we were calm and attentive to our inner feelings, we felt some positive effects. We were centered. Focused on the present moment. Giving each day the importance and place it deserves.And then. THEN! Finally.On the news, it was announced that we would regain our freedom of movement in ten days. Ten days! It still seems too long, we're so impatient, and at the same time, we're finally seeing light at the end of the tunnel.This time, we didn't lose count of the days. The count's reversed. Each day, I texted you or you texted me: only seven more to go! Only four to go! Two days left.At last, our doors opened.We stuck our nose out, cautiously, like wary animals out of their dens. As if we were no longer accustomed to reality. To the outside world. It takes 21 days for a human being to acclimatize to something.It was a masked parade down the streets. A government obligation. Just because life was finally getting back on track did not mean we were out of it.We have crossed a point of no return. This period has changed us, and we are starting a new era.On TV, the cameras showed reunion scenes in train stations. Lovers, families. People separated for months, finally reunited. The happiness was palpable. They, too, would no longer take their loved ones for granted.And, oh, remember that first sip of beer? We were sitting on the terrace of this bar, the one we used to go to all the time. The place where we met. It made us feel funny as if, at any moment, the police would come and order us to go home.We opted for our usual pints of white beer. We were finally looking at each other for real, eye to eye, not separated by a screen. The sun was shining its last rays on our skins, while drops of condensation were dripping from our glasses.From now on, we must keep in mind the positive realizations this event has brought to us. The beneficial changes. Cherish them in the depths of our being.We've learned to seek happiness inside us.We went through it. We stood together. We were strong. We were hopeful. Let's savor this happiness. All this is now behind us."
Salt and Vinegar,"The magazine on the coffee table has been on page six for over a decade now. It's been frozen in time using the chips clip that once bound the bag of salt and vinegar chips in the pantry, one bag a week. Dave, setting out every Sunday morning between eight and nine, would always pull one bag off the shelf for his wife, Anne. The infernal things, he couldn't quite understand the appeal. They burned on his tongue but she devoured them like candy.Page six always brought him a smile, reminded him of a time when everything felt the way it was supposed to — Dave didn't have any doubts about his life, or any wishes for things to change even the slightest. For Dave, a perfect evening always consisted of an iced-tea, sweetened, alongside Anne, hers unsweetened, on their back deck as they watched the sun sink below the neighbors treeline.""Cotton candy sky in the morning,"" said Anne, one warm evening in April, ""and caramel apple at night.""""Nature,"" said Dave, exhaling after popping his lips following a sip, ""sure is sweet.""They both held their bellies in laughter.The day the reporter, as Dave referred to him as, arrived was unusually cold for May. It was a Tuesday afternoon and the reporter had taken an extended lunch break from his day job in order to visit. When Dave answered the door he was half expecting to see a grown man, thick framed glasses, a collared shirt, perhaps a laptop tucked under one arm and a briefcase in the other. Instead he gestured in a young man, no older than twenty, who wore no glasses and had his hair tied up into a bun.The reporter removed his shoes without being asked, which pleased Dave, and added them to the small collection on the rug in the foyer. Instead of a laptop the reporter only had a composition notebook and a pen behind his ear. As the made his way into the kitchen he removed his light jacket and placed it over a chair at the table, then removed something from the coat's inner pocket and placed it beside the bowl of fruit at the table's center.""What's that?"" asked Dave.""A recorder, in case my notes aren't too good.""Dave smiled and gave a slight chuckle. He then called out to Anne, who'd been in the other room reading.""Almost finished with this chapter!"" she replied.""So,"" said the reporter, ""how do you know the magazine's editor Mary?""""I went to school with her mother, actually bumped into her the other day at the store. I was scanning the aisle for Anne's chips and noticed Mary had taken the last bag."" Dave smirked. ""I almost got down on hands and knees to beg her for it. We got to talking, and then this all transpired.""""Well I'm excited to hear the whole story,"" said the reporter.Anne emerged from the living room, a huge grin on her face.""You won't believe who the culprit is,"" she said to Dave. ""My bookmark is a few chapters ahead of yours but you'll have to read a bit after dinner so we can talk about it."" She turned her attention to the reporter. ""Pleasure to meet you.""When they were all situated at the table, and the red light was blinking on the recorder, Dave and Anne nestled into the story of how they met.""How old were we?"" asked Anne. ""I must've been twenty, you're five years older so you were…""""Twenty-five,"" continued Dave, ""and our parents had been trying to set us up since we were teenagers, we'd gone to the same church you see,"" he said as he pushed his face towards the recorder. ""And we'd seen each other in passing, talked briefly here or there, but we'd gone to different schools.""""Whenever I was single he'd be dating someone and vice-versa. It drove our parents crazy.""""Then one day, I think I'd skipped breakfast and just grabbed something on the way out,"" Dave stroked his chin and looked up to the popcorn ceiling for the memory. ""I had a bag of chips I was eating outside the church. I didn't want to bring them in so I was eating in a bit of a hurry, and it was tough because they tasted quite terrible.""""I saw him eating,"" said Anne. ""His face was twisted into knots after each bite, it was hysterical. I was walking in with my parents when I noticed the bag and asked him for a chip. They were my favorite…""""Salt and vinegar,"" said Dave, ""and she helped me finish the bag so we could go in. That was the first time we'd really spoken to each other, aside from the polite how-do-you-dos. Both our usual spots had been filled in, so we sat together and ended up going out for drinks afterwards, well, tea.""""He takes his extra sweet,"" said Anne, wrapping her fingers around her husband's wrist, ""and I like mine just as nature intended.""""She likes it to taste like sewer water."" Dave threw his head back and cackled.""At lease he has good taste in women,"" added Anne.The photographer stopped by the day after they'd told their story to the reporter. She snapped a few pictures, and that was it, she was in and out in less than ten minutes. Dave couldn't contain himself, he felt like a celebrity, and couldn't believe their little memory would make its way into print.The magazine was bi-monthly, so they waited until July for the issue to turn up at the grocery store. Dave placed it into his cart, right alongside Anne's chips. When he arrived home he read it aloud and watched his wife revel in the memories of their meeting. He displayed it on the coffee table, the cover becoming crinkled as he'd push it on anyone who'd visit to check out page six.As the years went on, and Anne resided somewhere beyond the popcorn ceiling, he used the bright green chip clip, the one he'd always see in use in the pantry, to leave page six open, on display for everyone to see, where he could always be reminded day after day of how he'd managed to be so lucky, and the greatest breakfast he'd ever had."
A Rose For Everyone,"On the morning of the coffee taste-off, Joe's Café was jammed with customers. Sarah stood behind the counter with her co-workers, pleased that her idea had taken off. Now she would get that well-deserved promotion to shift supervisor. With the extra money she would be able to buy her daughter the prom dress she'd been talking about for the past month.Making ends meet hadn't been easy since the untimely death of her husband two years ago, but now it seemed like things were changing for the better.Sarah counted twenty people already in line, each waiting to taste one of the special coffee drinks named after the employees. As the posters announced, the first thirty customers would each receive a free cup of coffee for the next seven days. Whichever drink received the most orders would then be a regular offering on the menu.Tightening her apron, Sarah greeted the first customer. ""Good morning. What would you like to try?""A handsome man with eyes the exact color of his blue shirt met her gaze. ""I'll have …"" His gaze moved to the nametag on her shirt. ""The Sarah Special.""Sarah smiled as she wrote her name on the cup and set it down on the counter for her co-workers, Megan and Lisa, working the bar this morning. Her drink consisted of one shot of espresso and sweet milk brought to a light foam.After paying, the man wished her good luck. She handed him his free drink coupon. He smiled and took his coffee to a table in the corner of the coffee shop.On the thirtieth customer, the register dinged, indicating the last of the winners. ""Congratulations,"" Sarah said to the teenaged girl on the other side of the counter. She had a bright smile and warm eyes. ""You are our last winner of the day.""""But we're all number thirty,"" the teenager said, waving her arm to include her three friends. ""I'm buying all the drinks.""""So, then, you're all winners,"" Sarah replied.After taking their orders, she handed each of them a coupon for their free coffees.""Thanks,"" said one of the teenage girls. ""You know, what goes around, comes around."" She flashed Sarah a big smile, reminding Sarah of her own self-assured daughter.Several times during the hour, Sarah caught Blue Eyes staring at her. Each time her heart sped up a little. He appeared to be about fifty, a few years older than her. He didn't carry a laptop or have one of those funny ear things connected to his head like so many of the younger customers.He sat reading the paper, or sometimes just looking out the window. Maybe he was even widowed, like her.Before leaving he came up to the counter. ""That was very nice of you to give all those girls free coffee,"" he said.""It didn't seem right not to,"" she answered. ""How'd you like yours?""""Delicious. Just like it says, the richness of coffee with a touch of love."" His eyes sparkled as he spoke.""Next time you should try the Megan Special,"" Sarah suggested.""Maybe I will,"" he answered.She wondered if he meant that maybe he'd try Megan's drink or maybe he'd be back. She hoped he meant that he would be back tomorrow for his free coffee.He was. And he came back the next day and the day after that. Every day until the end of the week. Each time he ordered the Sarah Special, even though it wasn't even on the menu anymore.Every day he sat in the same corner. He would sip his coffee, read the paper, glancing at her every so often, but never saying more than a few words. Oh, he did introduce himself. But other than knowing his name was Ken, that he had just started working at the bank across the street and liked sweet coffee, she knew nothing else about him. Except that he made her heart speed up like a crazy teenager in love.At 8:50 every morning, he folded up his paper, tossed his cup in the trash and waved to her as he pushed open the glass door of the Café and walked out.Tomorrow he would have to pay for his coffee and Sarah feared he might not return.The next morning, she woke up earlier than usual and arrived at work fifteen minutes before her scheduled time. She had half her mind on preparing lattes and blended mochas. Well, maybe one fourth.The other three-fourths kept watching the doorway, willing Ken to walk through and into the café. But today, her will just wasn't strong enough.She promised herself that if he did, she was going to say more to him than their usual ""hello"", ""how are you?"" and ""goodbye."" But where was he?During a lull in customers, a deliver boy walked in carrying a half a dozen roses. Their sweet scent drifted the throughout the sitting area and through the work stations.""Oh my,"" Megan cried. ""Look at those flowers. I wonder who they're for.""""They're for all of you,"" the boy said, as he handed one long stemmed rose to everyone working that day.When he had two flowers left to pass out, he asked which one of them was Sarah.""That's me,"" she said.The boy handed her the remaining roses. There was a note attached to one of them.""Dear Special Sarah,Will you have dinner with me tonight?""Sarah looked up. Sitting at his usual table was Ken, giving her a smile that touched her soul like a bonfire.On shaky legs she walked over to his table and sat down. ""That was sweet of you, to send us all flowers,"" she said.""It didn't seem right not to,"" he said. ""You all work so hard.""What goes around, comes around, she thought. Her staff certainly deserved the recognition.""So, about dinner?"" Ken reached over and lightly touched her hand.Stay healthy and happy. Keep your loved ones close."
The Binding Freedom of Letting Go,"Prakash held the receiver loosely by his right ear, letting everything flow through his left. Film Producer Kalanidhi was strict with deadlines, and Prakash knew that if the deal fell through, he would have to hunt for a routine 9–5 job. This would be his last stint as a composer. There were bills to be paid and in the war between passion and practical needs, he refused to let passion lose.It had been a month of inspiration hunting, but every time he turned the knob, not a drop of inspiration fell. He listened to Mozart, Beethoven, Rahman and every other legend that he worshipped, but their blessings didn't seem to reach him either. Now he was running out of time; his head had started to ache. As he gulped down an analgesic, he wished there was a pill for creativity as well.Prakash looked outside his studio window. It was late evening, yet the humidity of his city made him wish there was room for a human being inside his refrigerator. ‘It is early June, where are the clouds hiding?' he thought as he scanned the darkening sky.The analgesic was working, he felt drowsy. Praying one last time to his idols, he switched off the studio systems and rested his head on the table.It was the thunder that woke him up. He looked outside the window and saw that the clouds had finally arrived and were showering upon one and all in the city. ‘Thank God' he thought groggily. The leaves danced as the raindrops hopped over them. The trees swayed in celebration as the winds nudged them to do a jig or two.Prakash descended the staircase of his studio so that he could get a whiff of the earth that had just been graced by the showers from above. Children danced in glee; Prakash felt a strong urge to undress and join them. For a moment, he felt that he was free from deadlines, free from money constraints, free from everything else bothering him. It was just this moment that mattered.The sound of the drops of water hitting the asbestos rooftop at the adjacent building had a distinctive and continuous rhythm. This combined with the sound of the leaves, and the shouts of joy from the children ignited the spark that Prakash was searching for. He ran upstairs and switched his studio systems back on.""Brilliant. Absolutely Brilliant. I don't care which Korean song you jacked this rhythm from, but I loved it!"" Kalanidhi agreed to clear the rest of the payment within a week; Prakash let out a sigh of relief.Inspiration is a gift from nature, for anyone willing to listen, Prakash learned."

How Firewatch’s UI enhances immersion,"Firewatch slowly crept up on everyone and blew them away, like the video game version of a forest fire (erm, the good kind). A narrative-driven mystery light on game time and heavy on dialogue didn't seem like everyone's idea of a sure-fire hit, but players constantly found themselves engaging with the almost-real world of Shoshone National Forest.Multiple GDC awards and 1 million unit sales later, there is general consensus that Firewatch aims for a niche and hits it pretty well. That niche is immersion. Firewatch wants to put players in the head of Henry, the fire lookout protagonist, and also wants to put players in the environment, with all its underpinnings of foreboding and isolation. And while the brilliant writing, believable voice acting, and gorgeous environments go a long way towards making this immersion happen, I think an oft overlooked aspect is the smart UI choices that Campo Santo made while designing this game.Let's run through a primer on video game UI and analyze why Firewatch's UI choice helped them double down on their niche so successfully.A must-read article on game UI (without delving into research pieces) is this piece by EA Dice designer Marcus Andrews. I'll explain some terms that are necessary to understand the intelligence of Firewatch's UI:Organism: This is you, player and all-round awesome human being.Avatar: This is Mario, Sonic, Solid Snake, Henry the fire lookout. The in-game character that the organism controls is separate from the organism, no matter how realistic the gameplay or cosplay.The UI is the plane the organism passes through to become the avatar. Since the avatar is traditionally dictated by game developers (if you play a space marine game, the hero is a space marine), the goal of UI is to make the organism feel adequately that he or she is the avatar.With me so far? Let's go a level deeper:Diegetic UI: Interface elements that are visible both to the organism in the real world and the characters/avatars in the game world. For example, in the GIF below, both the GPS marker attached to the car and the map in the avatar's hand are diegetic UI elements (because they are visible to you, the player, and also to every character in the game world). These elements usually offer the most immersion and form a seamless plane between the organism and the avatar.Non-diegetic UI: UI elements only visible to the organism in the real world and not visible to in-game characters/avatars. For example, in the GIF from Uncharted 4 below, the ammo count, gun icons, and grenade counters on the bottom left of the screen are non-diegetic (because you, the player, can see them but in-game characters cannot). This is hardly the most immersive UI choice, but usually performs well with respect to functionality and getting the necessary information across to the player.Spatial UI: UI elements that are presented in the game's 3D space (whether they are visible to the characters/avatars or not). These can be diegetic or non-diegetic, they just need to be rendered in the 3D game space. For example, the blue waypoint markers ahead of the batmobile in the GIF below are examples of spatial UI.Meta UI: UI elements that are not visualized in the 3D game space (whether they are diegetic or not). For example, the on-screen blood splatter in the Gears of War GIF below is non-diegetic (the player can see it, the avatars cannot) and meta (it is not visualized in the 3D game space).Apologies for going all textbook-y there, but I think being aware of these UI distinctions and their respective utilities make it much easier to understand just how Firewatch got it right.Enhancing immersionFirewatch is a game where protagonist Henry volunteers to be a fire lookout in order to escape his demons and lose himself in Shoshone's woodland environs. In order for the UI to convey these feelings of isolation and exploration to the player, Firewatch mostly sticks with diegetic UI choices.For instance, the map. It's not your standard mini-map on the bottom of the screen à la GTA or a digitized map that you bring up through the menu screen. This is as close to a real paper map as a game can get.When you need to see the map, Henry will take out the map. He updates paths on the maps as the game progresses, circles areas of the map that are of importance; basically anything that a real fire lookout would do.There are multiple occasions when you need to visit a new area of the forest based on radio conversations or external occurrences. Directions are given based on map landmarks, and players have to toil with map and compass to reach these places.Is it tougher to navigate than non-diegetic maps? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely. It sells the feeling of forest immersion and exploration much better than an HUD map ever could.Did I mention the compass? Because you have to literally take out a compass every time you want to orient yourself in Firewatch.The same logic applies here. The player's avatar is a fire lookout, and fire lookouts (especially those new to the job) don't just automatically know where north is. Exploring Firewatch's world would be much easier if a compass was constantly visible on some in-game HUD, but exploring Firewatch's world shouldn't be easy since exploring is the entire point.The radio, which forms a big part of this game, is also a pointed diegetic element. Henry can take out his radio to report almost anything of significance, reply to incoming messages, or just chatter with the enigmatic Delilah about the vicissitudes of life.Firewatch keeps this desire for immersion through UI constant throughout its short adventure. Near the end of the game (when things get a bit weird), Henry has to follow beeping sounds on a tracking device until it reaches a certain frequency and the meter flashes green.Striving for balance and functionalityThere's a reason non-diegetic UI is so popular despite its immersion-breaking characteristics. These UI elements are efficient and clear, giving information to the player in the quickest and simplest way possible. Firewatch does occasionally use these elements because exploring this world shouldn't be so difficult that players quit the game.For example, the game visualizes when Henry can reply to a radio message by popping up a small radio icon on the left of the screen (visible only to the player, not to Henry).Text markers will appear on the screen to identify any object that can be interacted with, reported on, or is of interest to the narrative.Your various choices of radio conversation also show up as on-screen text (non-diegetic).Firewatch's UI isn't perfect (non-diegetic elements do occasionally break the immersion) nor is it revolutionary (Games like Far Cry 2 have used diegetic UI elements to great effect before). But I think Campo Santo took player immersion as their lodestone, crafted as many diegetic UI elements as possible, and used non-diegetic UI as the supporting cast to fill in the gaps whenever there was no other option.And for this honest attempt at making every part of the game — narrative, gameplay, and UI — consistent with their themes of isolation and exploration, I think they deserve our appreciation.Any other games that use cool, unconventional UI to enhance the overall experience? Any other UI tweaks that Firewatch uses that I missed out? Let me know in the comments."
How Valorant compares to CS:GO,"Having watched my fair share of streams during the Valorant closed beta, I'll be comparing some of the differences and similarities between the two games. Mainly looking at the mechanics of the game, the maps and the classes and their utility/ability usage. Having not actually played the game yet, these are just my opinions based on observations.The gun mechanics share a lot of similarities with CS:GO, with the spray patterns looking easily recognizable for all CS:GO players. It does look slightly easier to control though and things like penalties for moving and shooting, do not look to be quite as severe. Overall the skill ceiling for raw mechanics seems to be a bit lower than CS:GO.Something I find very interesting about Valorant is how the movement mechanics remind me more of CS 1.6 than CS:GO. The models move slower — making holding angles a lot more viable, as well as the CS:GO wide swinging a lot less viable. The ‘tagging' effect of being shot also contributes to this, (being slowed down when hit.) Basically you have more time to react to players coming around corners or swinging out at you, than you do in CS:GO.In theory this seems better to me — if you have the option to choose your position and angle that you want to hold, you should be rewarded for that and have the advantage. I believe this is the solution to the ‘peeker's advantage' issue that CS:GO faces. The way the gun and movement mechanics interact with each other gives the game a familiar, yet different feel — when compared to CS:GO.Moving on to the maps, they share obvious similarities — every map has at least two bomb sites and some kind of middle area. I phrased it like this because the map ‘Haven' actually has three bomb sites. I must say I don't like this idea — I don't think the maps need to be overly complicated or have some kind of ‘gimmick' to each of them. Having three bomb sites on a map or having a map with teleporters or whatever else, doesn't feel necessary to me. The complexity of how the map is played should come from the way the players interact with the map and doesn't need to be overly complicated.Map images courtesy of Blitz.ggLooking at the overviews of these three maps, it also looks like there is an excess of small areas and angles to clear, as you move through the map.Having mentioned some of the things I don't like about the maps, there is a lot I do like. The general aesthetic and clean feel to them is certainly a positive. There is no visual clutter and the angles and design definitely emphasize competitive play.The differences between the abilities and CS:GO utility usage is where the games really differ the most. I'm not going to go into all the classes, as there are plenty of videos and guides available and I'm sure classes and abilities are going to be changing fairly frequently, as the game moves from closed to open beta.Looking through all the abilities that each class has — some of these abilities bear a close resemblance to utility usage in CS:GO, while other abilities are nothing like anything in CS:GO.Many classes have a smoke or vision blocking ability that can be used to block off choke points or help you get into bomb sites. In terms of vision blocking abilities there are also walls that can be created. These walls cover a much larger area than the ‘orb' like abilities and have other effects as well. There are flash type abilities, although far less than would be used in a typical CS:GO game. Not many classes have the ability to flash areas, putting more of an emphasis on aim when taking map control. There are also a few molotov/incendiary type abilities.At the moment these abilities seem incredibly powerful when used properly. A well coordinated team can just steam roll their opponents when using their abilities together. I'm sure things will be balanced out though, as the game moves forward.This brings me to a point I really don't like about this class system so far — I think they are trying to make it more complicated than it needs to be. I feel like if they just keep introducing more and more classes with each update, the game will be incredibly hard to balance. Balance the existing classes and let players master them before even thinking about adding any more.Based purely on observation, I really like the look of the game. Certainly more positives than negatives in my mind and I can't wait to play it. My only concern is them making the game more complicated than it needs to be. The game itself should be fairly simple, the way it's played should be complicated.Class guide courtesy of RockPaperShotgun.com"
"The Helpful, Harmful Sounds of Thumper","I somehow extricate my eyes from the screen, feeling the mental drain and shortness of breath of a marathon-runner even though I haven't left my living room. Has it been two hours? It's been ten minutes. I trudge off to sleep, almost certain that the jarring percussive tones and red-upon-red hues of Thumper will pay me a visit after my eyes and brain are shut off for the night.Thumper is an intense, tightly-designed rhythm game where you play as a chrome-tinted beetle racing down otherworldly highways and have to correctly match inputs to remove obstacles in your way. Due to its highly abstract yet laser-focused nature, the game can be studied through many different lenses. I could discuss how it does a great job walking the tightrope of game flow, or how its long levels are broken into bite-sized chunks that keeps players engaged even after they've failed an inordinate number of times.But — perhaps unsurprisingly, given it's a rhythm game — I'd like to focus on the role sound plays in Thumper, beyond just providing the background beats for every level.Headphones at the ready?Thumper is not an easy game, especially during the later levels. The split-second timing required to get past breakneck processions of barriers from hell can make for some controller-throwing moments. To ensure players stayed engaged and didn't tap out too early, it was vital for the game to ease them in and introduce elements in a manageable environment early on. Thumper does this very well in its first level, and sound plays an important part.The first action you're introduced to is the ‘thump': pressing a button right as a small, square hue shows up on the track.The next element is a crimson side panel that you have to bypass by banking a turn at the last second.The third major element is a hurdle on the track that you have to break through.Now these elements start showing up together in various permutations. Here, Thumper uses sounds call-outs for every element as it shows up on the track. A thump sounds different than a side-panel that sounds different than a hurdle, and this sequence of sounds gives the player a few vital sub-seconds to prepare for the succession of button presses ahead.If it wasn't already clear from the GIFs above, Thumper is a cacophony of colors at first glance, which can make it difficult for new players to differentiate the elements on the track from the general background. The sounds of Thumper hold your hand here, providing a vital source of secondary stimulus that shape your muscle memory for the more challenging levels to come.The video clip below shows a 10 second example.Auditory feedback is the spinal cord running through most rhythm games, and Thumper is no different. If you saw the video above, you'd have noticed the sounds that accompany every successful button press, a satisfying mirroring of the call-out sounds of each element.The sounds also change as the player's timing changes. If you time a turn ‘good enough', there's pleasant but muted musical feedback. But if you time a turn ‘just right', you get a heightened ping as your controller shakes and the beetle glows with glee, telling you beyond doubt that you've just done something right.What I find really interesting about Thumper's auditory feedback, however, is when you get something wrong. The player can get hit twice in the game before they have to go back to the start of the stage, and that first hit is like a vermilion vignette of horror.The video below shows an unsuccessful banked turn. Metallic sparks envelop the screen as the beetle explodes into red dust. For a second, the background percussion and your attempts at rhythm fall silent, replaced with the grating sound of machinery gone wrong. And then the game continues as if nothing happened, resuming its pace while unmindful of your presence. You're just about able to overcome this setback and get back to the rhythm of the level.Sound is your enemy here, yanking you out of the game's flow and then plunging you back in like a sword being heat treated. Whenever I get hit once in Thumper, I usually get hit again soon after because the auditory whiplash of the first hit is still fresh in my brain.Thumper doesn't have selectable difficulty levels on the main game menu. This is a risk because the designers have nowhere to hide if players can't get past a level after finding it too tough. One of the ways Thumper walks this difficulty tightrope is by making the main path (relatively) easy but having a ‘high risk high reward' path running in parallel for more experienced players to tackle.This branching path technique is something platformers use quite often. In the screenshot below, Mario can take the path on top for safe passage across the pit of spiky circular cacti, but he'll have to forego the row of coins and tantalizingly placed power-up brick on the lower path. Younger or more inexperienced players will still be able to complete the level, while Mario veterans will still have challenges to sink their teeth into.Thumper replicates this idea almost entirely, although its base difficulty is much higher than for most Mario games. Your main path won't have many things that can kill you (after a bit of practice, at least). You can miss some blocks and not time your turns to perfection and still complete levels. But there are always optional elements on your track to interact with, like rings floating in the air, blocks that require you to change the track you're on, and alternating sets of blocks and hurdles.Where does sound come into it? You take the more difficult path because that's how you match the rhythm and beats of the level. You feel a lingering inadequacy upon finishing a level with ‘C' scores, barely scraping by without really doing what the sounds of the game have asked you to do.So you go back and jump above some spike pits at the last second, bounce up and down to break through rings and hurdles with unerring accuracy, and finish up with a gratifying combination of thumps and banked turns to the beat of the level. Like the video below shows.As you continue hitting every note, you'll notice other incentives that Thumper provides. Correctly timing a few beats and bouncing down on a block after you're in the air gives you a health pick-up. In the video below, you can see a block light up in the distance after a successful bounce, which is the health pick-up and restores the beetle's outer layer of armor.You'd be forgiven for thinking that rhythm games usually get more melodious and musical as you get better at them. But something remarkable happens in Thumper if you start making perfect runs through long stretches of a level. The beats get less musical and more violent, every bounce shakes the primordial soup your track and beetle are on, time signatures get warped, and one beat starts before the previous beat can finish. The game doesn't feel like you belong in its world, and the sounds are making this clear to you.To understand the influences behind this, it's important to look at how Brian Gibson and Mark Flury, the creators of Thumper, met and started the project. Both Flury and Gibson worked at Harmonix together: Gibson was an effects artist for Rock Band and Flury did UI and menu programming for games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band. But Gibson (who also played in a noise rock band called Lightning Bolt) had some ideas that were too unconventional for Harmonix to consider.In this video on Noclip, Gibson says:Thumper removes the trappings of conventional rhythm games and goes for something different because it wants you to feel something different, something oppressive and overpowering as you enter a world that's either outer space or inside your head (or both). Its Lovecraft-meets-hightech visuals are unlike anything you've seen before, and its disconcerting music that lacks music is unlike anything you've heard before.Gibson says:In 2015, Flury hosted an experimental gameplay GDC session where he had this to say:And that's a perfect way to put it. There's no better way to sign off than by watching 30 seconds of rhythm hell. Musical? No. Cathartic? Thumping yes.For more stuff on game design, you can visit my Medium profile to read my other articles or follow me on Twitter. Thanks for reading!"
Video Games & The Inevitable Becoming,"Going through Kevin Kelly's book about the 12 inevitable tech forces that will shape our future, I was curious about how this might apply to the video games industry. In the first chapter of his book — The Inevitable — he speaks about this idea of ""becoming"". A state of being that sounds contradictory at first, one of constant evolution — the idea of moving from fixed products to always upgrading services and subscriptions.He opens up the chapter by stating how ""…everything, without exception, requires additional energy and order to maintain itself"". I think he is right when he says that ""…code corrodes…"". Us humans are never content for very long, and then we hunger for a feeling of progress. For example, video games need an updated to run on newer systems. If not, then they might rust, cease up and — one day — stop working.Everything is so interconnected now, ""…upgrade this; then suddenly you need to upgrade that"". Kevin aptly likened the current need for incremental upgrades to personal hygiene, ""…you do it regularly to keep your tech healthy"". If it is inevitable that fixed products become services, how has this, and how will this affect the video game industry?The platforms that a game releases on is the factor that influences the design of a game the most because it is the first point of contact for the consumer. Determining when, where, and who is playing because of its price, availability, portability, filters, features, etc. The business model of a platform, in turn, influences the business model of the games on it.I wrote the original version of this article shortly after Google revealed its new gaming platform called ‘Stadia'. A streaming centric platform which touted the ability to accessed the latest compute-heavy games through nearly every device you own that has a screen. Since then, Stadia launched with a very compromised vision. Something that is much more lacking and restrictive, as well as offering weak incentives to developers and consumers alike.However, I think it's initial pitch is still telling of where industry leaders are headed.Stadia had proclaimed that you [the consumer] never need to update hardware or software ever again because all of that is taken care of on the server's side. Simply access the service through your pre-existing smart devices and use any of your pre-existing controllers. Even swap between devices with ease.Xbox's ‘XCloud' service and PlayStation Plus are the closest analogue to Stadia at the moment. Notably Xbox's parent company Microsoft has already invested heavily in their cloud computing Infrastructure.Amazon is another big player in the space, with their cloud services gathering close to 50% of the market share. They are spending in the game development space too, having produced their own proprietary engine — Lumberyard, based on the acclaimed CryEngine — and have been steadily investing into game creation for many years.Even beyond the platform holders, game publishers like Bethesda are already investing in creating better tools to help their studios build games for streaming.I must briefly acknowledge that a platform like Stadia does bring up a lot of questions around — the already dismaying issue of — ownership and preservation of games as an artistic medium. I don't have much to say right now, but it's worth taking note.At the time, we didn't know a whole lot about Stadia's business model. There was reasonable speculation that it could operate much like Google's Play Store on Android. With it being free to access the service and ‘Free To Play' apps, but there are also premium apps and add-ons that require a purchase. Google would then get a cut of any item purchased or rented on the platform.As of now, Stadia demands a monthly subscription to access the service and also requires you to purchase games at the standard market rate, while also being limited to a few select high-end smart devices and reliably fast internet. There was a planned ‘free to access' version, which would have fewer benefits, but that has yet to materialise.Most folks seemed to have been hopeful that Stadia could have a subscription model that - like Xbox Game Pass - gives you access to the entire library of games on the service. I suspect that is because — if successful — it would have shaken up the market.On an episode of the Dude Soup podcast following Stadia's announcement, Alanah Pearce predicted that Stadia (especially if it charges a subscription that grants access to every game on the service) would disrupt the current trend of lifestyle games. That being individual games that you're expected to play as part of your routine and attempt to be a content delivery platform onto themselves with regular updates (a ‘live service game'). She suggests that this could incentivise many games to take on a similar business model to a lot the mobile market (referring to more short-form experiences). Since you — hypothetically — wouldn't need to pay to access each game individually then you would be less compelled to stick around.Likewise, on a similarly timed episode of the Game Informer podcast, Kyle Hilliard expressed concern that people won't really get to love a game because it will be too easy to move onto something else.I think those are reasonable concerns, but I don't believe this will become the norm. Although there certainly will be growing pains.Before I go any further, I should stress that I am just one person and I have — what I imagine is — a rare perspective on video games compared to the breadth of the game buying public. I have worked in the industry, and I spent four years studying in a Game Art & Design degree programme. I know that I have my biases and — so — I invite you to share your thoughts with me! @RichToTheArdYo on Twitter or in the comments further down.I have a PlayStation Plus subscription that grants me the ability to play PlayStation games online, but it also gifts me at least two entire games a month. I don't play most of them, but every now and again — and maybe I am the exception here — I do try out a game that I probably otherwise wouldn't have bought. Sometimes I find that I really, really like it and then I buy some DLC to expand on what I liked and as a show of support.Maybe easy and instant access to a wide range of titles will not devalue every game, but will instead enable people to find those games that they would value the most and wouldn't have realised otherwise.That's a little simplistic and probably over-optimistic. On the flip side, the games that would have excited me previously don't have that same effect due to the sheer amount of well made unplayed titles in my PlayStation library.The user interface of the PlayStation 4 doesn't help my perception of a game's worth. The UI allows me to filter my game library to see every game at once or just the games I got through PlayStation Plus, but it won't let me see only the games that I deliberately purchased. That alone seems to harm the perceived value of purchasable games for me. They no longer stand out once I buy them, they are more easily lost in the crowd, so why invest?My point here is to attempt to demonstrate how much power the platform has over your experience and the surprisingly large impact of such small design details.The success found by FTP (‘free to play') games cannot be understated. Regularly making up half of the top ten most played games on Steam.Of course, Steam is missing many of the big core FTP hitters such as Fortnite, League Of Legends and HearthStone. But there are many other healthy FTP games out there for most genres. I'm personally enjoying Warframe on PC at the moment, yet I have 250 games (and counting) on just my Steam library.Warframe is a lifestyle game. I hop into it for up to an hour every other day because I enjoy its core gameplay and making a little more progress on my extrinsic goals. It's familiar, and that is comforting. Very comforting, in fact. To the point where I may put off playing other games that I might enjoy more at that moment in time.Comfort is a powerful motivator. So I would argue that having access to more games does not mean you'll play an individual game less thoroughly.I would imagine that — if you are an avid player of games right now— your behaviour on that front will largely stay the same. I believe the most significant impact will be felt by those who have yet to embrace the medium.I'll discuss that idea more under the heading ‘Newbies'.Admittedly, there is a period when you are adjusting to a game, and you are not very emotionally invested. It's easy to walk away at that point, especially if you have are not financially invested too. Warframe was not a game that gripped me immediately. I actually gave it a go back in 2017 and bounced right off it. But I decided to give it another go recently because of what its community had to say.I'll discuss that idea more under the heading ‘Prosumers'.In a best-case scenario, live service games would produce more of what the consumer likes. In a more worst-case scenario — as we have seen several times in even the last two years — it can encourage a practice of releasing an unfinished game experience to consumers. It can (hypothetically) be finished later, it'll bring some money in the door now, and people will (hypothetically) return when it is much improved.A lot of this is because of growing pains as studios restructure and adapt their tools to support continuous post-launch content updates.However, something else to consider as a consumer is that live service games are not typically designed to be finished. I would liken it to watching a TV show instead of a movie. Admittedly that line has become blurry in recent years…As the Motley Fool reported in a 2019 earnings call for Electronic Arts (EA), CEO Andrew Willson stated: ""our entire marketing organization now is moving out of presentation mode and into conversation mode and change in how we interact with players over time.""EA intends to adopt a soft launch approach. Up until now, many live service games have been sold as completed mass-market products despite part of the sale pitch being the game's future potential. A soft launch approach means that their games would be marketed as more bare-bones products initially and aimed at a niche audience that would enjoy riding the development wave. How a product was framed — through its marketing and pricing — had caused much of my frustrations with such titles in the past. Setting appropriate expectations is very important.For game companies, this is a much safer bet. You no longer get only one chance to impress, you can get more use out of a game after launch, and the increasing need for post-launch support could ensure that employee jobs are more stable.For the average consumer, I can't see there being much of a change from now. The fear of missing out is potent, so there will always be big expensive ‘completed' blockbusters that cast a wide net. Be it to get people onto a platform or to make a profit.However, those who are more engaged with the hobby will likely see more modestly budgeted niche titles emerge. I've seen a growing number of games find success through word of mouth. With decreasing barriers to entry and increasing online connectivity, this trend will undoubtedly continue to grow.Going back to Kevin Kelly, he also touches on Prosumers and the idea of leveraging the audience to create content. As an interactive medium, this is a big topic to cover for video games. A Prosumer is someone who both consumes and produces content. As a topic, that could encompass Streamers, Modders, access to powerful developer tools (like Unity), or even games modes where the player can build their own levels or parts of it and — honestly — most media outlets. It's a broad label. Staying somewhat on topic with what I already discussed, how do Prosumers fit into the live service business model? Influencers.An aspect of the soft launch approach is to foster evangelists in your audience. A live service game will never be finished in the strictest sense of the word, so I imagine its marketing budget has to be spread out more. Without that one final day where the product can be declared to be ‘ready for all to see', I would think that it is more difficult for the marketing team to persuade people to hop on at any one point in time. That is where your friend's recommendation comes in and that of influencers. Cultivating evangelists will increasingly become part of a game's marketing and release strategy.During a talk titled Designing ‘Path of Exile' to Be Played Forever at the Games Developers Conference (GDC) in 2019, Chris Wilson spoke about the importance of accepting that players will leave your game eventually. But that players can return if you release sizable new content at a predictable rate. He mentioned how he got this advice from the streamer, Kripparrian, who figured that a live service game is not so different from the business of live streaming.I believe he has a point. You can increase your organic traffic by encouraging habits, getting your audience to say ‘oh it's the first day of the month, that means there's new content'. Regular updates also mean that more people will be paying attention to the game in the media or on your website even if they are not currently engaging with the game itself. They might be done with the current content but eagerly await the next.Gaming can be an expensive hobby. A modestly powerful phone, console or PC can still be a costly barrier to entry for someone who isn't sure if they'll enjoy the experience. If someone does invest in a low-end device, they may have a poor experience and call it quits. A game might run poorly for them or not at all. They may have tried out poorly made games or had an uncomfortable setup.Streaming won't solve all of this with one fell swoop, but it does have the potential to enable more devices to deliver a more reliably consistent experience. You will have more of a say over when, where and — maybe — how you play a game. Doing what suits you better, pulling focus away from the device and towards the game experiences.A subscription could also help bring new people in. A wide selection of experiences to try out off the bat, and it's also a very familiar proposition — at least for people in the Western world. Many people already have subscriptions for music, movies and even groceries, likely expecting the same for games.Kevin Kelly notes how — due to constant evolution — everyone will always be a ‘newbie'. A humbling notion worth keeping in mind.Before finishing this piece, I opened up Apex Legends for the first time in about a year, and it immediately befuddled me with all the added bells and whistles (new art, additional progression systems and like, along with a series of pop-ups).It isn't even that different from the last time I played, and the core game is the same. Yet when I launched into a couple of matches and I was even more befuddled.The game has a new map, new weapons and new characters with new abilities. Maybe I'm ageing faster than I realise, but I figure that my befuddlement was the result of expecting things to be the very same from the last time I played. It didn't help my self-esteem to (due to not playing in a long time) be grouped with and defeated by people who had a much lower level than me. I had become a ‘newbie'.I got over all that and shucked some of the rust off before too long. But I was surprised that I was surprised by the changes. I spoke earlier about ‘comfort' as a powerful motivator. I think I went to play Apex Legends because I sought an old comfort.How do you keep your product friendly to new users and lapsed users while retaining your existing users? Managing that balance is going to be the biggest challenge for designers in the industry going forward.With constant evolution and the increasing prevalence of algorithmically chosen content, it is easy to find ourselves in isolated echo chambers. Unaware of the sheer magnitude of change around us. There is no ‘THE Internet'. There is only MY Internet and YOUR Internet.It's easy to think of ourselves as being knowledgeable but — by ourselves — each individual actually knows very little. So I would hope that we can all be patient with each other in this ever-changing world.Sh'laters,Richard."
Skyrim Has Problems On PS4 Pro,"When Skyrim first launched in 2011, it became an overnight phenomenon. Like it or not, it's one of the seminal examples of the fantasy RPG. I played it to death across the Xbox 360, PC, and PS3, racking up hundreds of hours of thrilling viking dragon adventures and tens of hours of hitting zombies in caves with various axes.A current generation re-release was inevitable, considering Skyrim's rampant sales success, and sure enough the game launched on PS4, Xbox One, and PC in 2016 in a new ""Special Edition."" At the time, both consoles ran the game at a rock solid 30 frames per second in standard HD resolutions, and brought along new volumetric lighting inherited from Fallout 4, new textures and materials, and newly enhanced shadows and visual effects.The PS4 release had some obvious sound bugs, though. The surround sound mix and channel placement wasn't right for any sound effect in the game, most notably voices. They sounded fine if they were in front of you, but the second a character's voice panned out of the center channel, it became omnipresent in all the other speakers, as if they were a mythical god shouting at you from all directions.Any sound in the game that's made up of multiple sequential samples had its ending deleted, too. This meant that when a dragon stopped breathing fire, there was no flourish or smoke noise at the end of the sound, just a sudden awkward cut. Similarly, every single spell your character can cast awkwardly cut off in the middle of playing its sound, instead of finishing the full effect.These might not seem like outright deal breakers, but they were immediate and annoying bugs to anyone that had played the game even a little bit before. A quick Google search turns up countless threads like this one about these very issues, dating all the way back to the launch of the game. I hoped for a quick fix. Sometimes Bethesda promised vaguely to look into it, other times the reports were met with silence.That silence was a big hint about the further PS4 Pro mess that was coming.In 2017 and 2018, when the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X launched respectively, Skyrim Special Edition was one of the few older releases to receive an enhancement patch to take advantage of the new hardware. Both upgraded consoles run the game at a full 4K resolution, and the new art assets look as good as they do on a high- end PC.Unfortunately, when running the game at 4K, the PS4 Pro can almost never sustain a solid frame rate. The game runs well enough inside smaller rooms, but any time you're outside or in combat, it regularly stutters and lags. It feels deeply unsatisfying and hampers controller feedback, similar to the recent issues with Borderlands 3. It's constantly noticeable since you'll spend about 70 percent of your possibly hundreds of hours in the game engaged in the sorts of activities that tank the performance.In a revelation that may not surprise the long-time Bethesda fans out there, the sound bugs mentioned above were never fixed. So, if you play this classic game on PS4 Pro, you'll witness constantly lagging performance and hear sound that doesn't work correctly. Both of the Xbox One consoles and even the Switch run the game more consistently, and sound correct. The issues on PS4 Pro are simply inexcusable.Bethesda has had almost four years and numerous patch opportunities to fix up the PS4 version of Skyrim, but has instead used its regular updates to implement new microtransactions through their Creation Club. Now that the company is focused on updating Fallout 76 and working on two new large single player games, I doubt that they will ever get around to fixing this older release.It's a shame, because the Pro's performance issue could be quickly fixed by slightly lowering the resolution, or implementing the dynamic scaling from the Switch version. The sound bugs don't appear anywhere else so they shouldn't be too hard to isolate, either.Skyrim has been a perfect way for me to fool my brain into thinking I'm outside during the current stay-at-home orders. But while its visuals, design, and general scope represent Bethesda at their finest… the lingering obvious issues and sad performance on PS4 Pro represent the company at its worst. Every Bethesda fan has to swallow their pride and accept this awkward compromise of ambitions and technical muck every time they release a new game, but I hope that some day we no longer have to make excuses in order to enjoy their games."
Match Prediction in League of Legends Using Vanilla Deep Neural Network,"The first general public response is money, and true, maybe money could be made with a sufficiently successful prediction model, but perhaps that is just looking at the small picture.A bigger picture can be seen by dissecting the model. A successful win prediction model tells us exactly what contributes to the victory of a match.For example, suppose that one of the data points used in the prediction model is player height. If it appears through the prediction model that the taller the average height of the team, the more likely that team is going to win the match, then we can derive from the prediction model that contrary to our beliefs, player height is actually crucial in winning a League match! This could fundamentally change the scouting system for professional League E-sports teams around the world.Why care about E-sports industry in the first place, you might ask. Well, in 2019's League of Legends World Championship, 44 million people concurrently watched the finals on November 10th, and 100 million unique viewers turned in for the event online. That exceeds the Super Bowl viewership number of that year.¹ And with the growing popularity of the industry, the numbers are expected to grow continually.One final reason to study the numbers behind E-sports is accessible data. There exists some debate on this topic, as RiotApi (an api for acquiring match data, made available through RiotGames, the pubilsher of League of Legends) offers restricted and inaccurate data, which could be the reason why most research papers on the same game genre are based on DotA2, League's rival. However, the data is free. This is a huge advantage compared to other traditional sports like soccer, where meaningful data can only be acquired through costly subscriptions from firms like Opta.As mentioned before, scarce few prior studies on League of Legends match prediction exists, but the opposite is the case for DotA2 match prediction. As these two games are of the same genre with similar game plays, these studies are worth exploring.The paper Dota 2 Win Prediction, for example, offers a predictor that has 73% accuracy, using features such as offset, matchup, synergy, and countering.²Another paper To Win or Not to Win offers a predictor that has 74% accuracy, using co-occurrence network to uncover hero synergy data and using logistic regression to do the final magic.³As amazing as these results are, there are certain improvements to these prior studies that can be applied to attain better results.First, both papers treat each hero as an individual vector in the input, or in the data pre-processing process. This lets you ""consider the individual impact of each Radiant and Dire hero on a match outcome"" but also has the danger of training the prediction model too narrowly on each champion.⁴ For example, the prediction model will not be able to look at Ornn as a champion with tankiness and a lot of magic damage, but just as Ornn himself. It will miss the traits that define individual champions and fail to generalize with other similar champions.Second, both papers don't take into account the skill of the player controlling the hero. It is quite obvious that a professional player controlling a hero would have much bigger influence on the game outcome than an average player controlling the exact same hero. Therefore while the influence of the hero, its synergies, and its counter-picks are all important, the skill of the player also matters. This could be an additional feature to improve the prediction power.The problem with RiotApi is that it is difficult to get a set amount of match data on the go. It is necessary to pinpoint one player, and then go through his match history, then on to match history of players appearing on his match history, to recursively collect match data.Even when the data is acquired, it must be filtered to make sure that the lane positions of the champions are marked correctly. In more than half the cases, Riot incorrectly marks the lane position of the champion, marking three champions in top lane, four champions in mid lane, zero champions in bot lane, etc.RiotApi also enforces a rate limit to 100 requests every 2 minutes, and that coupled with the high probability of corrupted data meant that I had to run a script on a custom AWS EC2 server for several days endlessly digging for match data.In my research, I collected 1045 match data, of which 80% were used as training set, 10% as dev set, and the rest 10% as test set.What really separates my model from prior studies is my selection of features.The features I have used for my model are win-rates.An obvious fact about a League of Legends game is that a team of good players controlling strong champions would win. Here being a ""good player"" means more specifically that the player is good at controlling that specific champion, as the player has to be able to match the champion's play-style to maximize the champion's potential.So the problem becomes, what data shows the following two features in numbers?The first feature is captured by the player's win-rate with that specific champion. For example, a player who only plays a champion named Nidalee will most likely have a high win-rate when playing that champion.The second feature is captured by the win-rate of that specific champion in the current meta/patch. A strong champion is known to have a high win-rate (usually equal to or bigger than 53% when counting from all tiers combined).We collect this data for every player in each team, so that each input vector to the neural net would be 20 data points large, like the following:[0.5114, 0.52, 0.5275, 0.619, 0.5074, 0.727, 0.4999, 0.517, 0.5187, 0.659, 0.5034, 0.0, 0.5005, 0.5, 0.4448, 0.257, 0.5065, 0.286, 0.5199, 0.544]The result is that I have an input feature that is only 20 large in size. This is extremely small compared to the input features used in previous studies.As mentioned in the title, I used a vanilla deep neural network, meaning a fully-connected feed-forward deep neural network with four hidden layers. I used the tflearn library to build the model, with batch training included. Various parameters and hyper-parameters were tried, including the number of hidden layers. As excessive as four hidden layers seems, it seemed to produce the best results, although the performance as differed little with two or three hidden layers. I won't reveal the exact parameters/hyper-parameters, as it should be pretty easy to reproduce the results by setting your own parameters.The performance of the neural network depended on the parameters/hyper-parameters, but the most representative numbers were as follows:Training accuracy: 0.7255Validation accuracy: 0.6905Test accuracy: 0.7033Also, as softmax activation was used at the output layer, the output vector shows a degree of ""confidence"" the network has in the match being a victory or a loss as a vector of size two (for example [0.317, 0.683] would show that the model believes the match to be a loss). The numbers in the output vector do not directly translate to the ""probability"" of a win or a loss, especially because batch training was used, but they do give a general sense of the likelihood of each event. So I gathered all the matches where the model had 0.8 or more ""confidence"" that the match will result in a victory, then got a 76.76% accuracy: for certain matches, we could be pretty sure about the result of it.What remains so promising about this model is that there is a lot of room for improvement, and therefore, a possibility for greater match prediction accuracy.When placed into a League of Legends match, each player is assigned to either a red side, or a blue side. Traditionally, there has been a difference in win-rate depending on which side you're positioned on, and while in the current patch there is no big difference (50.3% win-rate for the blue side), it is a number that changes from patch to patch and can be taken into consideration.⁵Synergy is one of the features included in previous studies, and is solely responsible for the 74% prediction accuracy recorded by To win or not to win.⁵ Coming up with a way to accurately reflect champion synergy and include it as an input feature could enhance the model's accuracy.In the current data used for train/dev/test set, some data were impossible to find and therefore were left to chance. These loan to the fact that I heavily used op.gg and other League of legends analytics websites to gather champion statistics specific to players.For example, if when per-processing the data, the python crawling script could not find a champion specific win-rate for a player, that win-rate got automatically assigned a 0.5 value. This was a reasonable choice because in most cases, the champion specific win-rate does not appear because of the lack of that specific champion's usage, which means that it is just as likely for that player to be bad at using the champion as he/she is good at it.With more refined data with less holes in them, the performance of this neural network model could improve.A common phenomenon between players is that sometimes players get in a ""roll."" This means that when a player has been winning several matches in a row, he feels that he is likely to win again the next match, and vice versa. In professional tournament settings, it is nearly a given fact that a team could have very different performance depending on the form of the players. KT Rolster in LCK Spring 2020, for example, performed extremely poorly for the majority of the season, but showed remarkable prowess in the last two weeks of the tournament, owing to the increased ""form"" of the players and the team. This could also be an additional feature that impacts match prediction.Very similar to champion synergy, yet a bit different, champion composition refers to how a team is structured before a match. For example, the blue side team might have one healer champion, two tank champions, and two dealer champions, which depending on the patch/meta could influence that team's win possibility. Another distinction could be the ""early-game"" champions and ""late-game-carry"" champions. These labels differentiate champions based on when that champion has the most influence on the game, and therefore could be another way to represent team composition.I have confidence that improving the prediction model with additional features and better data will enhance the prediction capabilities of the model, perhaps over the 74% baseline set by one of the prior researches.Hopefully with more advanced prediction models, we could set guidelines on the best team composition, and what specifically to look for when scouting for future professional players. By coming up with a successful model and examining the weights, we could potentially gain insight into how important mastery of a champion is in comparison to team composition, etc. This could impact not only the scouting system of professional teams, but also their strategies in championships.As I am in serving in the military right now, I do have limits in how fast/efficiently I can pursue this research.

Why Stadia is More Important to Google than You Think,"In case you are wondering: yes, the thumbnail is correct! Let me explain why you should look at Stadia as a Netflix competitor.Creating, maintaining and growing a public cloud business is an enormous investment, but it can be worth it if you believe (like I do) that public cloud infrastructures will be the key element for any future of computing.Google has been investing in GCP since 2008, they started after AWS and were never able to catch up in global market share. AWS leveraged the startups and the SMBs to gain immense popularity and traction, Microsoft leveraged their relationship with Enterprise and the power of their ""lock-in"" towards CIOs to enter the public cloud business. Google's cloud market share is about 5%.A very simplified way to frame the current public cloud market is that AWS started from startups & SMBs, then raised the target bar towards enterprises, while MS is doing the opposite, starting from enterprises and trying to scale down. Google? Google has been squeezed in the middle with less adoption than the other 2 vendors and less traction on both small and big companies. Google has to find a way to drive hordes of developers to their service and their best chance is to bet on a different, disruptive approach because the ""standard businesses"" have been already taken by either AWS or MS.Let me switch context for a while. Videogames used to be something you bought once and you could play them forever. Piracy was a problem back then and complex copy-protection schemes were engineered to try to reduce the problem but it was not very effective and it was also expensive to implement, adding costs to an already very expensive development cycle.The first game that I remember implemented a different approach was Quake from ID Software. Quake forced users to activate the game online, by registering a product code and users needed to get online to be able to validate that code. It was not good enough at the time, because ID Software couldn't rely on the fact that users would have Internet connection whenever they wanted to play: the Internet was a very scarcely available resource, almost luxury in some countries.As the Internet became widely distributed more companies relied on ""online"" authorization to let the players access their game. Don't be fooled, this was not to increase game appeal or accessibility, it was to reduce piracy and to increase revenues.As the requirement of Internet connection became more common, new business models became viable. World Of Warcraft is a very well known example of a subscription-based game: players would pay every single month to access their game, and it was MASSIVE. WoW lasted more than 10 years and had way more than 10 million players in its peak seasons, every single one of them paying about 30$ each month (360$/yr). Do the math.Today, mobile games and modern desktop games implement a similar strategy, it's not a mandatory monthly payment anymore but a series of ""optional"" microtransactions that you are, more often than not, forced to buy to stay competitive. So it's a subscription-based model masked as a free-to-play model. 30% of gamers pay for subscriptions (source Gamasutra).Supercell's Clash of Clans, a very popular mobile game has been generating over 1M$ revenues PER DAY for years (source gamerevolution).The catch with modern popular games is that in order to serve that amount of users and the low latency expected, companies must invest an immense amount of resources in infrastructure, often cloud infrastructure. The good news is that the ""server"" part of the game is the same (or almost the same), regardless of the different client platforms accessing it. The ""client"" part of the game, however, is usually totally different from platform to platform and it requires to be heavily re-engineered to be available on multiple smartphones, consoles or desktop operating systems. This cost is a mandatory cost to increase market size.I'm pretty sure you understand where this is going…Stadia is a streaming service that allows players to play a game without having a client platform. It's basically a controller that interacts directly with the game server. There is no client, no android, ios, ps4, ps5, Xbox, pc version of the game… it can be accessed by ""any"" platform as long as you are part of the service.There's also the increased accessibility: players won't need to upgrade their hardware to access the best and the greatest visual and sound effects, because it will all be just based on bandwidth alone.Stadia brings game development studios a way to develop the game just once and lets players access it everywhere, as well as a way to completely stop piracy and decide the visual/audio quality based on the publisher's budget for the server architecture, not forcing customers to upgrade their systems.Google has YouTube, a 15B$/yr business, twice as much as Google Cloud (source Alphabet earnings report). YouTube 20 million paying users are a very interesting market for game publishers.Sounds too good to be true? Think harder, it is even better than this. Multiplayer games will not have lag since everyone will be playing on servers, lag can be ""easily"" controlled. Game developers and publishers can push systems to their limits without caring about ""porting"", piracy, and lag. At the same time, they will have the widest gaming market ever created, because every single person with a good internet connection will be able to play, without having to pay an upfront fee to buy hardware that will become obsolete in 2 years.This power Google will have can be used to force publishers to accept a different business model: Stadia could apply the same strategy Netflix used to disrupt movie industries.Nintendo (consoles) and Valve (Steam) will be forced to reinvent themselves or perish because their businesses are not sustainable once a StadiaTube is out the.Nvidia (hardware) and Sony (consoles) are trying to compete with Google with their own services but they are both late and lack the distribution channel (Google has YouTube, Amazon has PrimeVideo).Microsoft is the biggest threat to Google's Stadia success because they have the infrastructure and they already are in the gaming industry (with Xbox), the Xcloud project has all the prerequisites to win, but it lacks the distribution channel.Amazon has the technology, the distribution and also a strong presence in the gaming community through Twitch, but it didn't show plans to participate in the game-streaming market, yet. My guess is that they will first try to win the Apple-Netflix-Disney battle via better content and market share (Amazon Prime).Will Google be able to leverage this advantage and find new oxygen for its Cloud & Services business?"
A Chronicle of How I Escaped the Coronavirus,"Day 1: I have made the difficult decision to move to a deserted island in order to escape the novel coronavirus. The natives here, though friendly, are obsessed with buying, selling, and trading. They will pay island currency for anything; fruit, rocks, even grass plucked from right outside their own doors. Through a series of bizarre, tedious transactions, I managed to trade in my tent for a small, shoddily constructed house without spending a single cent. It felt dishonest, but everyone exchanges their principles for a little comfort sometimes.In addition to being die-hard capitalists, all the residents of this island are talking animals. Indeed, that is why I selected this particular island to escape to. So far as I know, talking animals cannot get the novel coronavirus. Dating seems impossible for now. Otherwise, this island is the best life I can ask for. The talking animals are friendly. I am full. I am safe. Nothing can harm me.Day 4: Built a bonfire. Listened to some avant garde jazz on a cheap, baby-blue radio I bought with a bag of island currency, which I got from selling moths to some raccoon entrepreneurs. Had a nice time.Day 6: Received a message in a bottle that simply said ""Beware!"" Also in the bottle was a news article about a non-talking tiger in the Bronx Zoo who tested positive for the novel coronavirus. I didn't even know tigers could read. Gladys, a talking hippo who recently settled on my island, assured me that talking animals cannot get the virus. So far, I do not know of any non-talking tigers here, but if I see one, I plan to keep my distance.Day 10: Just learned that the ""novel"" coronavirus has nothing to do with novels at all. I did not bring any books, not even the ones on the list I made especially for deserted islands. I could have been reading this whole time. At least I have peach-picking, fishing, and bug-collecting to occupy my days.Day 11: It's official: Barkley, a talking badger, has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Isolation measures have been imposed, something I never expected here on this deserted island. God knows when we'll get the supplies we'll need. I called the rescue service. No answer.The talking raccoon who runs the supply shop says he can build us a 20-bed hospital if we bring him 100 pieces of softwood, 200 pieces of hardwood, and 300 gold nuggets. This is impossible, and the son of a bitch knows it. Last week, in a peach-induced haze, I smashed all the rocks on the island so he could have his precious corner store. He gave us a DIY recipe for ventilators, but those raw materials, too, are in short supply; they require 100 iron nuggets each and the helium from balloons we sometimes see flying overhead. I have not yet figured out how to catch the balloons. Do ventilators even work on badgers?Day 16: I have started a postcard correspondence with Agnes, who lives on the other side of the island. She says the kinds of things you'd expect from a talking pig. ""I'm so lonely, snuffle, I leave antique chairs and lava lamps on the sidewalk for my friends, snuffle, but I yearn for true connection, for the warmth of contact, for the touch of a hand on the small of my back, snuffle."" I see her out gathering shells every morning through my window. After a few fermented peaches, she becomes considerably less unattractive.Day 19: Moved an inflatable couch from the left side of my house to the right side. Moved an electric guitar from the right side of the house to the left side. Put some succulents on a table I made out of tree branches. Boxed up three thousand cherry blossoms I gathered for use as toilet tissue. Moved an inflatable couch from the right side of the house back to the left side. Took the succulents off the table and stuffed them in my pocket. Sat in a chair.Day 22: Two little raccoons came to the house today, looking for payment owed the big raccoon. I pretended not to be home. How am I supposed to earn income when I'm supposed to be social distancing? Come to think of it, how am I supposed to be social distancing on a tiny island at all? Every time I walk outside there's a fucking walrus or something trying to get my attention. We're all about to die and they want to talk about exercising, or scrapbooking, or some bullshit. I spent so much time picking fruit, getting stung by wasps, selling fruit, collecting wood, getting stung by more wasps, and for what? To line their tiny pockets? If I weren't so afraid of getting near them, I'd punch them in their masked faces. (I don't mean to perpetuate raccoon stereotypes; they are actually wearing masks, per island rules.)Day 24: Crucian carp are becoming scarce. I have five kinds of fruit but no sources of Vitamin D or B. I called the rescue service again. No answer.Day 26: Visited the talking dodo at the airport to see if he would smuggle me out of this miserable hell and to the relative safety of Doodlebug Island, some 12 miles away. The miserable bastard wouldn't do it. ""Oh, drumsticks! That won't do ya any good!"" he squawks, barely visible for all the condensed sweat in his shield visor. ""Everyone on Doodlebug Island is dying of the novel coronavirus, too. They burned all the books in town last week, but still no good! It's the end times!"" He gives an air of someone cognizant of his own imminent extinction, as you might expect from any essential worker these days.Day 27: I'm almost certain I have rickets. I spend a lot of time fantasizing about eating my isle-mates. Cannibalism seems natural on an island full of anthropomorphic versions of things I used to eat back home, but it's out of the question now. You don't know who could be infected.Still, there the raccoon sits in his gilded gift shop, lording his wealth over the rest of us, squeezing every last drop from the common islander. If there is one who deserves to be skinned and eaten, it is he. ""They will perish, all the factions that rely upon their power in order to destroy our freedom."" Robespierre said that. Robespierre was a man, not some stinking, horrible beast. If he had been an animal, he would have been a good one, like a wolf or a Tasmanian devil. Not some stupid hedgehog, not a skunk, not a strangely alluring pig. Certainly not a raccoon.Day 29: Donated my last bit of island currency to a singing dog's Patreon.Day 30: The tanuki suit has been removed. I dare not write any more on this topic. Suffice it to say: I am full again, I am safe again, yes, yes! Safe from viruses, safe from the laws of man, safe even from the laws of nature. Here on this island, nothing can harm me."
without title,"I had the pleasure of seeing Lost Words: Beyond the Page during its development more than two years ago. At that point the game had a different art style, but the vertical slice that I was able to play immediately captivated me with its unique gameplay style and interesting story concept.Lost Words: Beyond the Page seeks to tell the story about a young girl struggling with the loss of a relative. This heartfelt narrative is delivered through an interactive diary come storybook, with the player guiding the young girl through its pages.Recently, I had an opportunity to speak to founder of Sketchbook games, Mark Backler. I asked some questions about both the game's approach to storytelling, and more pragmatic decisions made in releasing the game (such as Stadia exclusivity).We started out by talking about the narrative inspiration for the game, where Mark talked about different narrative projects from both game and film that interested him and the team.MARK BACKLER:So, we tried to draw inspiration from lots of different areas and kind of films like The Labyrinth that we all liked. And games like Edith Finch and Gone Home kind of really interesting narrative projects. They're kind of borrowed from all over the place really.Our writer — Rhianna — knew she wanted to write something that could make a difference to people and that was also a powerful and universal topic.When I asked about how they tackled the challenge of representing loss and grief in a video game, Mark spoke about how they consulted with a mental health expert.MARK BACKLER:So, we met up with Caitlin Hitchcock from Cambridge University — a researcher on the various approaches to psychological treatment. She had a meeting at the Welcome Trust in London and kind of talked her through the game, the concept and showed her what gameplay we had.Then when we wrote the script, we sent that over to her to look over and she gave us feedback on it. Then we put that in the game and then sent her videos of that, which she gave us more feedback.Mark went on to talk about how the game incorporated current psychotherapy techniques into the games narrative presentationMARK BACKLER:Caitlin talked about a therapy technique called the Compassionate Image which involves looking back on difficult moments through your present self. And so, we tried to incorporate that into the narrative of the game itself.So this influenced when Izzy (the games playable character) is older and looking back on things. Also how the process of grief isn't just a linear thing and you can backslide into different stages of grief. That was something that we tried to cover with some of the final level revisiting past stages that you've been on your journey throughout the game.Moving on from the game's design, I wanted to speak to Mark about the decision to publish Lost Words as a Stadia exclusive.MARK BACKLER:It was through our publisher, Modus, they they met with Google. We were showing Lost Words at E3 and Google came around to look at all the games that were being showcased by Modus. I got to speak to them a little bit then but Modus secured the deal.Mark spoke about how difficult it can be for smaller studios to get their games noticed, highlighting the importance of partnerships and marketing.MARK BACKLER:It can be tricky these days to get a game noticed and even really awesome games don't necessarily sell the kind of units that they need to to kind of recoup the development cost. It's getting harder and harder. Marketing is more and more important, but it's tricky and expensive and not guaranteed to get you x number of sales or anything.I think we're lucky right now to have new platform holders like Google with Stadia and Apple with Apple Arcade and Epic with Epic Game Store. They're looking for exclusives and are interested to fund games to be first out on their platform.Something I'm personally invested in is game accessibility and looking at ways that can help more people to play. To close out our interview I asked Mark about accessibility and any steps they took to help ensure that the game was accessible.MARK BACKLER:I think accessibility is something more developers and players think about these days. Some of the feedback our user testing showed was around the color of text and ways that we can make things easier for people to see.Being a small team, it is tricky because some of the options can be a bit harder to implement. It would be nice to have some kind of a full suite and we've got lots of options so you can play with keyboard or different controllers. Supporting fully customisable remapping is something we wanted but so far haven't managed to do, but we'd like to look at that in future updates.After the interview Mark also let me know that the studio had managed to figure out a means to add custom key bindings into the game for both the Steam and console releases. This feature will be introduced via an update and should go a long way towards making the game more accessible for players that like to play with atypical control layouts or custom controllers.Lost Words: Beyond the Page is currently available exclusively on Stadia, but the studio have plans to release on other platforms at some point in the near future. You can check out the trailer above and it's also available to wishlist on Steam here."

FAQ: How to Translate Writing Skills Into Editing Skills,"A freelance editor answers 10 questions about transitioning from a freelance writer to a freelance editor.The quick and dirty answer: no. BUT. If you're willing to work at it, I'd say that any author can become an editor. I'd been writing for many years before I even thought about editing as a viable profession for me, and when I first started editing, I knew next to nothing about it. However, I knew that I had a good eye for recognizing when something didn't work. Then, once I learned about the technical and creative skills I'd need to become a successful editor, I focused on improving those skills. This is #1 thing you need to do to become successful—be willing to learn and try new things.There are four basic editing services:My advice is to focus on what you feel you're best at. For instance, if one of your superpowers is brainstorming ideas or problem-solving, developmental editing would be ideal for you because you will spend many hours looking at a sometimes-problematic manuscript to figure out what changes need to be made to make their narrative match their original vision for their book. However, if you're one of those types of writers with an eagle eye who can spot a misspelled word from a mile away, you would do well as a copy editor and/or proofreader. And if you have an intense love for revision—don't knock it … some of us absolutely love this part of the writing process—you would be an excellent line editor. This requires both a creative and a technical eye for sentences that don't work or don't flow as well as they could.But you don't have to limit yourself to one type of editing service! I do all four of them, which allows me to take an entire project from start to finish, helping new authors shape their narrative into their dream book. And being able to be this kind of editor can allow you to make quite a decent income. (One of my contracts I signed last year was a low five-figure income. Though, it's a year later, and I'm still working on the project because I also started doing some book-promoting work for this author.)And beyond what type of editing service you want to offer, I'd also decide which types of books you feel you're more suited to. Fiction or nonfiction? Business or self-help? Science-fiction or romance? Beauty or fitness? Technical or creative? Young adult or middle grade? And the possibilities go on and on. I'd recommend picking a niche, even though that doesn't mean that's all you're going to edit.Then, I recommend you start educating yourself, or at the very least, look for an editor who is happy to mentor you through the entire process. I do this through the editing group I'm a managing editor for, and if you want to learn more about it, you can click the image below to learn how I got started as a freelance editor.Absolutely! Within a year of taking my first editing gig, I was making enough money to quit my day job to freelance full-time. That was in July 2019, and my business is continuing to grow, month by month. One other thing I love so much about the freelance life is that it also gifted me with the extra time to work on my writing projects when I wasn't busy editing someone's book.At maximum capacity, I take about four to five freelance-editing jobs per month. Many of these average around $1,000 to $2,000, but I also take jobs around $4,000 to $5,000 on occasion if their word count is a bit bigger. (I once edited a 120k-word-count memoir for around $7,000.) So, let's say I take five projects in a busy month (generally during the summer) … one of those is $1,000, one is $1,500, one is $2,500, one is $500, and one is $4,000. That's almost $10,000 in gross income per month. And if these are jobs I received through my editing guild, I'd pay somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000 in commission. Not bad at all for doing something you love! AND if you could do that for 12 months, you would have earned a six-figure income that year. It's not an unreasonable goal.There are several ways you can generate leads for new clients:An editing guild is a professional group of editors and/or writers that receive opportunities to bid on editing projects through the guild they belong to. I am a managing editor for an editing guild, and I send regular projects out to my editors to bid on. Then, the author decides which editor to work with, they sign a contract, receive payment based on their set rates, and the editing process begins. And this is exactly how I became so successful as an editor. Some editing guilds have different requirements for entry—some of the editing associations out there even serve as editing guilds. The editing guild I work for requires each member to first take their online course and pay a yearly membership fee to retain their eligibility for editing (and ghostwriting) projects. Then, our editors pay a commission based on how much the editing contract is. And because we have a large network of authors who use our services, we get a fair amount of editing requests regularly.Like any other business, you'll need to market yourself regularly. I use my website, social media, and email marketing to reach clients, but since I receive enough work through my editing guild, I don't have to actively market very often.They can be because most authors don't understand the market value of a good edit, and they can sometimes get scammed by low-cost editors who don't offer them much value. This is a huge problem in our industry, but it's not prohibitive. You may run into quite a few authors on these freelancing-gig websites who only want to pay $50–$100 to have their book-length manuscripts edited, but those kind of gigs aren't ideal for most professional editors. I think they are ok when you're first starting out, but if you stay at those low rates, it will be hard for you to build a successful business making next to nothing. I have to turn down projects a lot on these websites, and I don't feel the least bit bad about that because I am confident in the value I offer my authors. Rest assured, though, that there are authors out there who understand what a great editor can do, and they are more than happy to invest in the future success of their books."
Block-Busting: Writing exercises for breaking writer’s block (Part 2),"Today we're looking at a couple of techniques for adding depth, filling in plot holes and getting your narrative moving! This is the second in my series of tips and tricks for beating writer's block and creative slumps.Read on and prepare to be inspired…Journaling has always been a great way to keep your writing hand in and the words flowing but have you ever thought about having your characters write a few journal entries?I find this to be a great way for finding and injecting some extra depth into your stories. Sit yourself at the desk of your character (any character) and let them write from the heart, through you. Have them chronicle the events of your plot and how it has affected their lives in both significant and small ways. This is your character's opportunity to work through their own feelings and their feelings towards their castmates. While you're writing these entries, work on the individual voice and tone of your character. You might uncover some details and feelings which fit naturally into your main narrative, which you can use to add bonus detail and depth to your main narrative.Now, I'm not suggesting you randomly start inserting diary entries into your book (unless they are supposed to be there!); this exercise is intended to be a little something extra, just between you and your character. Or, you could polish them up and use them as free promotional material for your readers.This is a great one for getting yourself into the swing of a tricky scene. Most writers either love or hate dialogue — and by that I mean, most writers are either really good at dialogue or struggle with it quite a bit. Fortunately, this trick works just as well for writers in both camps.Strip a scene back to only dialogue and nothing more, like a transcript. To help you keep track of who is speaking, you can add a name before each line of dialogue. To begin, write nothing else and focus only on what lies between the quotation marks.This might be all you need to inspire your creative juices to start flowing more freely. If not, start to build up more layers. Go back and add some physical actions to the dialogue, insert notes about changes in the environment, plot points or the comings and goings of other characters. Gradually flesh out the scene until you have all the essential pieces in place.Now move on and write the next scene. Come back and redraft during the edit or when you're feeling inspired to tackle it again — don't let it hold you back any further.The answer to writer's block is very rarely not to write but, in fact, to write more. Unless you're working to a professional deadline, forcing yourself to work on something is not a universal solution — although it does work for some people. Have you ever heard the saying ‘A change is as good as a rest?' If you've come to a writing roadblock and simply persevering doesn't feel like it's working for you, try changing tactics.Switching to a different project or taking a break to work on a short writing exercise is a great way to sidestep a block without letting your good writing habits slip. Sometimes a good warm up exercise is all you need! Often, while you're focusing on something else, your brain has a chance to bubble away in the background and work through whatever is holding your back. Today's tips allow you to stay focused on your project whilst giving you a break from any problems in your main narrative.There is no one-solution-fits-all answer to feeling blocked or uninspired, so my advice to you is to try different approaches until you find one that works for you.Originally published at https://plotfactory.com on March 16, 2020."
Trying to write during lockdown? Here are 6 practical tips,"As most readers of this blog would know, a few years ago, I took a sabbatical from my job to learn screenwriting at the New York Film Academy.While I struggled to find my way back into the corporate world for the next 18 months, this writing sabbatical opened doors for me as a columnist for publications such as Mint, Maxim and FilterCopy. And then, after 3 failed screenplays and a sixty-thousand manuscript that's still not impressed my wife, Penguin India offered me a contract for my first short story collection titled ‘Buffering Love'.I hadn't set out to write short stories but ended up with a book that I am (reasonably) proud of and now have completed another short story collection that I am hoping finds favor with a publisher.But initially, what I really wanted to write was a screenplay that gets made into a film and one that people hopefully remember. So while that book was not the end-goal, that journey was immensely cathartic and fulfilling. I also learnt along the way that principles of great storytelling do not change with the medium. Fundamentally, the audience must be hooked to your story. Every page must turn with intent and every end must be gratifying.Given the context of the current lockdown in India and interest exhibited by a few of my friends to experiment with writing, this is as good a time as any for me to share some of the practical tips around writing that helped me transition from a columnist to an author. By no means exhaustive, this is a list of things I follow every time I start on a new writing project.So now, without much ado.It was Woody Allen who said that ‘80% of success is showing up.' For a straight 8 months during my sabbatical, I woke up every morning, got dressed and sat at the writing table for a specified period of time. Some days, I gave it 6 hours and some days 2 hours.A lot of people emphasize on the big creative idea/breakthrough for someone to write well. If there is one myth around writing that I'd like to bust, it is this. Yes, the idea is important but before that comes the discipline. Earmark a time (or times) during the week that you will write and then show up on the writing table. You'll be amazed with what happens.I've often heard from people, that they want to write more. To be blunt, it doesn't mean anything without a quantifiable goal.Every time I sat to write during those 8 months I mentioned above, I wrote at least 2,000 words. That was when I had no job. Now, with an intense job that occupies me every weekday and sometimes spills over on weekends, I have dropped my goal to 500 words anytime I sit to write.This quantification helps because discipline combined with 500 words can eventually lead to something bigger.A back of the envelope calculation of five hundred words a day for 20 days would land at a substantial 30,000 words in three months. That's a manuscript longer than Of Mice and Men, The Old Man and the Sea and Breakfast at Tiffanys.One of the first pieces of advice that Joyce Carol Oates gives in her Masterclass is that one must power through the first draft of a project the soonest possible. Ishiguro, when asked about his secret to winning a Nobel Prize, said that when he writes he allows himself to write bad pages.The first draft, you can take it from me, is s**t.Give yourself time to go over it again, and again and again and keep cutting the flab. More importantly, think about the characters and conflicts that can be enhanced. Think about the different ways it could end. This might mean sometimes a new direction altogether. Allow yourself to be open about it.Like my screenwriting teacher at NYFA used to say, ‘Write like a King. Edit like a Nazi'.There is no right pace for creative output and there is no point fretting about being slow. I often hear aspiring writers say that their pace is slow. There is nothing wrong with it. Do you have the discipline? Are you making your output quantifiable in some way? Can you go back and ruthlessly edit and kill your darlings if you need to? If the answer to all of that is yes, pace can go take a hike.Of course, studio and streaming commissioning folks and publishers have their own targets by which they need you to get back with revised drafts. But like everything else in life, you will have a say in some cases and in some cases you won't. Largely, it's better to focus on your story than on the pace at which you will finish the story.We all know what a brilliant film, Up (Pixar, 2009) was.Now, here's the first synopsis of Up from Ed Catmull's book Creativity Inc.For those here who have seen the final film, can you imagine this is where Up started? Catmull goes on to describe in detail the different versions that were iterated upon. He says it took years to revise upon changes one after the other.To cut a long story short, as you go about your third and fourth drafts and take inputs from your trusted inner circle of friends and family, a lot of fresh ideas will come to mind. Some will mean re-arranging plot, characters and in some cases even the ending. Give these a fair chance. If a film like Up could begin at a place which was so vastly different than what eventually won two Oscars, should you be really worried changing things? That question answers itself.This is a tip I struggle with myself and with good reason.In the streaming era with over a hundred apps designed to let you sit back and make an addict out of you to watch videos, it's tempting AF to not read. But reading good books gives you better return on your time in improving your writing than watching stuff.There is no exception to this. The world's best screenwriters, novelists, storytellers, columnists read a lot. Don't be the person who thinks just watching films and series will help you write better.Here's Stephen King's final advice in his seminal book on writing also called On Writing. ‘Write a lot. Read a lot.'So that's that for now. I hope you find these useful.Are there other tips that have worked for you? Let me know in the comments. I'd love to hear."
There Is A Story In All Of Us,"I remember my non-fiction writing class starting off with a room full of skeptics. Everyone in there — minus that one student — were wondering the same thing. How the hell do you make compelling non-fiction?Now, it's not to say we were all so far removed from the writing world that we didn't understand there are plenty of great non-fiction pieces. We were just under the impression that to write one of those there were certain criteria that had to be met. You're either an expert or professional in the field related to the book or you are the primary source of the material and you were helped by an expert. Regardless, our skepticism soon washed away. As I learned one of the most important lessons for writing ever.I don't think I'll ever be known as a non-fiction writer. If it does happen, we can reference this in the irony and ribbing that follows. But the activities we did and theory we discussed will be in all of my writing.The teacher — whose name I again can't remember — would have us do a couple activities. These activities are still with me today.It's funny, because when we first did this exercise, we all looked at him like he was nuts. I mean, you have to have some idea of a story before you begin writing. That's at least what we all thought. As we did this exercise each week, I began to see a pattern where my writing flowed more naturally. It started in an action and came off like a story. I was very surprised and happy. It was the first time I felt like a writer.And now I know that, that is the feeling I want forever. I write these article pieces and feel alive. I'm having fun and I don't care how they are received or even if they are received. That is the most freeing thing to me.Writing for the sake of writing.I hope I can give just an ounce of this feeling to another writer one day. It's invigorating. And to me one of the most important tools you need as a writer.This one was a lot more straight forward. Everyone understood it easier and went to town. I wrote something using this and it was terrible, but to be fair all my writing is terrible.What I found is that I didn't feel as natural doing this one and I wasn't alone. While the teacher said this is a perfectly good way to also find a starting point, I still felt something missing from this.Later, I would discover that I gravitated to the first exercise because of the freedom it gave me in my writing. I have a wandering mind and imagination. The worlds I create typically never stop getting created. It's just all about preference.Now, to bring this all together. These two exercises are not the only ones. They are just the two that opened my eyes. If you have others then share them. it's the feeling that I want to get across. That's the beauty of all of this. There is no one way. I write now more than I ever have in the past. I just started one night after work and finally couldn't stop. And I love it.Stories are in everyone.There in every moment and event you move through. There in every smell and sight. They come from the rain hitting a little harder and the beer going down a bit smoother.When you feel as if all the ideas have been taken or you will never produce anything on the scale of the greats or even a peer, try something for me. Do one of these exercises and see what you create.Because, the best part of writing is that there will always be more waiting to get out."
Deadlines Are the Best Thing Since Sliced Bread,"If you read the headline of this article and finished the thought with ""…said no one ever, "" this one is definitely for you.I suppose I used to feel the same way. Having entered college thinking I wanted to be a journalist, I quickly learned the importance of a deadline. But at the same time, unless something immediately pressing was happening in the world, deadlines felt sort of arbitrary.""They're just trying to be in control"", is what my non-conformist, all-knowing, early 20-something self would think about anyone who put my work on a deadline. This was true for any sort of job or assignment I crossed paths with. Even when I was waiting tables, being told I had 10 minutes to deliver someone their lunch made me tingle with frustration. How dare they interrupt my day with their urgency?Fast-forward to me launching my own copywriting business, and my opinion of deadlines changed quickly and dramatically. Here's what shifted my mindset.In the beginning, when clients would book a call with me, I would always get excited. ""They want to work with me!""Then I learned the real question is ""do I want to work with them?""One sure-fire indicator that I don't want to touch a project with a 10-foot pole is ""oh, you know, we have the idea but there's no pressure to hurry.""Their deadline apathy tells me a few things.Zero thought about a project timeline is my queue to tell them they may not be ready to work with me yet. I'm a copywriter, not a business coach.Being willing and receptive to recognizing this saves me my biggest asset. Time. And that brings me to my next point.I have, admittedly, accepted projects with those willy-nilly deadlines a few times. I have, admittedly, suffered the scope creep-slash-rape that comes along with it.It all starts out innocently enough.""We don't want you to stress yourself out!""""There's no rush!""""Take your time.""Meanwhile…""Oh hey, I know it's Saturday and we don't want to overload you, but we really need this email to go out Monday morning because…""And I'm caught deciding between canceling my weekend camping trip and telling them every client's favorite word. No.Or, ""we're not really in a hurry to get this up so we'll give you our feedback next week.""And I'm caught staring at the block of time I reserved in my calendar to review their feedback and make edits when I could have filled it with another project or client call.Despite any safeguards you may have in your business to convey your project process and timeline to your clients, some won't comprehend it and you'll have to break it down 17 different was until it clicks. Others will completely disregard it because some people always think they're entitled to be the exception.In reality, the only one who decides the exception is the one behind the wheel of your business: you.So remember this: deadlines give you freedom. Set them and honor them so you can live your best damn life, or whatever the kids are saying these days.If you do get caught in the habit of accepting wishy-washy client work, here's some good news: you can break the cycle by implementing deadlines.Imagine a drain has clogged in your home. You try the usual drugstore fixes, but nothing works so you call a plumber. They tell you their rates, and you agree. When they show up, they take a look at the issue. Then they ask you how long it should take them to fix it.You're not the expert in the situation, so how should you know? Time to hire a new plumber.The same is true in any business. Serious clients who truly need your skills want to see that you have a system to deliver their work on time and that you have some idea of how long it's going to take.Yes, some clients will be busy and barely give you enough of a brief to get started, and reading their feedback will be like trying to decipher ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. But others will have some idea of what the process should look like, and if you aren't ready for that, it's quickly going to become clear to them that your services are amateur hour.If you don't have a project timeline, develop one. Do this for each of your services. It doesn't have to be fancy. It could be a simple Google doc or pdf that explains how and when you get started, how and when you provide edits, and how and exactly when the final work will be delivered. What matters is that the client knows when they're going to get what they paid for.Even better than delivering work on time is delivering work early. When you're your own boss, there's no real reason that you shouldn't give yourself a nice, long project timeline to make this possible. Double or triple how long you think the project will take you so you have plenty of time to make yourself look great with an early delivery.I'll save the Honor Your Deadlines speech, because I have, in fact, pushed back deadlines. I hope someday I never have to, but for now, if I change a deadline, I follow these 2 rules:In my experience, moving a deadline has been due to new information or current events. If a new study came out that will strengthen an article significantly, or a global pandemic makes their email campaign feel insensitive, I wouldn't feel right delivering the work as-is. Never has a client been unsatisfied with hearing ""I'm looking out for you.""I haven't had any personal emergencies get in the way of making deadlines, but if I did, I would make sure they were aware of the situation without burdening them with too many details. Clients don't need to know the nuances of sick dogs or car accidents. They just need to know what it means when it comes to them receiving the work they paid for without. Leaving out the sob story shows you respect their time.The magic of this approach is that when you respect their time, they're more likely to respect yours.As a writer or creative, deadlines come with the territory. Will there be days where you're guzzling coffee and taking your meals hunched over your keyboard? Absolutely. But that's a whole lot better than getting caught in a cycle of attracting low-paying clients who expect you to put your life on hold at their every whim. That's a surefire way to prevent yourself from reaching your goals for many years to come.The moral of the story? Your time is money. Use deadlines to help you budget accordingly."
Take Your Writing to the Next Level With These 12 Free Tools,"When I was just starting out as a copywriter, I thought I had everything I needed. This included my MacBook, some legal pads, business cards that I've used exactly twice, and a whole lot of motivation to take my success into my own hands.Oh, sweet, naive Nessa.It wasn't long before I started hitting small, albeit time-consuming and annoying roadblocks. Anyone writing for a living knows that time is money, and anything slowing you down has got to go.I spent so many hours bowing down to my keyboard, second-guessing my word choice, sentence length, and headline selections. Once, it took me over 8 hours to write the first draft of a 1,000-word article—and that didn't include editing or revisions.Repeated moments of minor defeat had me wondering if I'd made the right choice.Rather than throwing in the towel, I followed tips from my mentor and asked other successful writers what they used to solve these problems. It turns out, there are a lot of free tools out there that can make you a better, faster, more sought-after writer!To save you loads of time and probably some screentime-induced headaches, here are 12 indispensable tools that will help you level-up your writing skills and efficiency without spending a dime.If you aren't aware, Grammarly is like spell-check on steroids. Get it, use it, quit publishing stuff with typos and grammatical errors because that's plain lazy. You're welcome.You may have heard that you should write at least 3, 25, or even 50 headlines before you settle on one. I don't count my headlines, but I do write until I run out of ideas.After taking some time to eliminate the ones that are total crap, I plug the top contenders into a headline analyzer like this one from Sharethrough. Generally, the one with the highest score wins, but I don't let a few points skew my human judgment. If I'm truly on the fence, I take one of two approaches.If this is for a client's blog or email list, I suggest that they implement A/B testing, or ask them to pick what they prefer.If this is for my work, I'll go with the one that feels better in my gut—or I'll implement the next free writing tool.Listen. Bouncing around ideas really works. Some of my best work happens when I'm not anywhere near my computer. If you catch yourself holding your breath trying to make a decision or get clear on an idea, get off your butt and go have a conversation about the subject with a real human.Being a home-body and introvert, this is usually my husband. Go figure, he usually has some good ideas, and talking about things helps me take a conversational approach when I get back to writing.Do you ever look at a headline and think ""should this word be capitalized?"" Even the most experienced writers can lose sight of proper title casing when they've been spitting out words for hours on end.This is where Capitalize My Title comes in handy. You can go for the standard title case or AP/APA/Chicago/MLA style, Wikipedia, Email and more.You may have noticed a trend that these successful writers on Medium—you know, the ones who are raking in the G's—talk about getting into a flow state. I've noticed gym workouts and showers are top tips for achieving this.Don't get me wrong—I completely believe those things work and understand the science behind it. But as a yogi, movement, breathwork, and meditation are my tried and true for entering a state of flow.I admit I don't always use this when the work is going to be published under my name. I do always use it for client work, though. How horrible would it be to learn that an article I charged someone money for was removed from publication or performed poorly because I failed to switch around some words and phrases?Plagiarism can happen accidentally, so check your work. This is such a simple way to add value to your writing services.Here's another tool I don't always use, but I did rely on it a ton when I first started out. See, there's this thing that can happen when you write where your normal conversation skills go out the window and you sound likea) a robotand/orb) an elitist douche.Jargon-packed, long sentences with too many adjectives are a waste of everyone's time. If you're struggling to make your writing more conversational, use Hemingway. You're welcome, again.In my humble opinion, there's no better place to write, format and share writing (before publication) than Google Docs. Have your beef with Google if you must—but you can't beat a free tool with these capabilities.Here are a couple of ways it helps me be efficient in my business.I used to be a legal pad gal, but after tossing so many in the bin, I realized that I was being a wasteful jerk. Rarely were my legal pad ideas worth saving.Since deciding to be an eco-friendly business, I use my giant whiteboard. This was an initial investment of around $60 USD and maybe a few bucks for pens and hardware to install it. I was probably spending $5–10 per month on legal pads. You do the math.I'm not attached to any ideas ever—a mindset a highly suggest if you want to be a copywriter—but if I think something is worth saving, I'll take a picture of the board before erasing.Part of being a copywriter is being a detective and asking things like…What are experts in your industry up to?What keeps your clients up at night?What keeps their clients up at night?What might people object to about the product, service or idea you're selling?What's the next trend going to be?These and oh so many more questions can be answered by listening to podcasts while cooking, cleaning or driving. This off the clock research can help you learn about your niche, identify sub-niches, and become an expert in new subjects in your free time.Or whatever else you crave to read. I personally love crime novels because:My current favorite author is Tana French. She'll give you plot twists that make your head spin, and you'll love her for it.You didn't really think I'd forget to mention Medium, did you?Having a place to self-publish is a true gift to writers everywhere. It motivates and inspires me to not just write for clients, but for myself and audiences I might not otherwise reach. While I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity to help my clients reach their goals, having some artistic freedom is essential to keeping the creative juices flowing.Ready to quit playing small and make real money writing? This is the exact course I took to launch a business that aligns with my values and quit my job in just six months. I believe in this course so much that I became an affiliate, meaning that if you follow that link and decide to go all-in, I'll receive a commission on your investment at no additional cost to you."
How to Deal With Beginner Anxiety as a New Freelance Writer,"There comes a point for most new freelance writers where they know the action steps they need to take, but they are still cemented by fear.They love to write, but they are worried that others won't want to pay them for their words.If you feel this way, know that you aren't alone. However, you do need to kick this fear and anxiety out of your business ASAP. Here are a few tips to help.Not sure what to pitch or write for a new freelance writing client? Research their site and answer these questions:Knowing these answers and reading through several articles on a potential client's website can help you feel more confident in your abilities. If your freelance client is new to the content marketing world, this is when you ask them to provide a few sites or articles they love.It is also good to know what their content goals are. For example, if they want to develop core content that is trustworthy, then adding trendy verbiage and Buzzfeed-style title is not a good idea.Fear of failing use to cripple me from pursuing goals. Then I started thinking logically. What is the worst that can happen to me in this situation?Most of the time was that I would be embarrassed or I would get rejected. These feelings are crushing at the time, but they aren't life-altering. If a client does not like my article, then worst that can happen is that they don't pay me, I have wasted time, and my ego is bruised.If your article is horrible, no one is going to take your kids away, burn down your house, or stop being your friend. This may seem silly, but the truth is that we put too much weight on failing and rejection in the business world.Here is what will likely happen if your article is not great. Either the client will ask you to rework it and then be satisfied with the changes or they will tell you that your tone isn't right for their company, and most of the time, they will pay you for your work.They aren't going to be calling up all of their to spread your name around or leave you a bad Yelp review.Their rejection is either a reflection that you need to tweak your writing or that you just weren't a great fit for the client. It doesn't mean you can't succeed in freelance writing.The point of asking what the worst that can happen isn't to put your mind in a negative space. Instead, it is to show you that the worst in your situation is not that bad at all. You can bounce back from rejection and criticism.Now think about what the best situation that can happen from this one article. The cool thing about this exercise is that the sky is the limit. You really have no idea how far one article or client can take you.Anxiety as a freelance writer usually comes from the desire to write an amazing article from the beginning. The best articles are not penned on the first draft. It can take several rounds of self-edits to get a piece where you want it.Instead of wasting time trying to come up with the best lede, just throw something on the page. Get the article written and then go back and make the tweaks you want.It is hard to polish a table when you haven't built it yet. The same principle applies to writing. You can't start the editing and refining process if the words and ideas are still stuck in your head.Many times you will find your article's tone or direction in the middle of the article rather than the beginning. This is why it is better to get your writing out than hemming and hawing over each word. Don't miss my post on getting started when you've never been published before.So start acting like it. William Zinsser said that writing is a craft much like that of a plumber. You get better at your job by doing it. You get better at writing by writing.There is no need to have beginner anxiety as a freelance writer because you are either good enough to break into the writing world, or you will be good enough after some polishing."
Time is Money: How to Get a Better Deal For Your Work,"Sometimes a market may not mention a specific fee, or they may say they'd be happy to ‘take a look' at something you're writing. Don't feel the need to follow their discretion; you're a professional, so ask what they'd pay if they accepted the piece. If it's much less than you'd hoped, and you still want to go ahead, you can at least tailor the time you spend on the piece accordingly.Work out how much you want to earn per hour and prioritise your writing commissions accordingly. Remember wordcount is not always the best guide here. Say you have two writing jobs to do: one is $300 for 1000 words; the other is 1500 words for $175. The first looks the better deal, only you know the second will take you 3 hours to write and will be signed off straight away, while the other is complicated and will take 10+ hours, plus loads of feedback and amends. Which one is the better deal really?Consider the likelihood of further work from the same people. A regular supply of straightforward work from a market you trust is probably more valuable for your career than an extra $50 from a market that will sit on your work for three months before they even acknowledge it.If you can't get any extra money, see if you get something else that's of value to you. An extra week's extension on the deadline or access to an expert to interview could be valuable if you have a pile up of deadlines or the expert can short-cut your research time. Or you might ask for retention of certain publication rights, extra author copies, or a cap on the numbers of rounds of amends (another time-saver, especially with content work!).Bigger fees are all well and good, but if you they take months to arrive, and you have to keep chasing them, that's a lot of time and effort wasted that you could otherwise have spent on new work. Often a fast, reliable, but relatively modest payer is better value for your career.Sales trainers say you should always be prepared to walk away if you can't get your minimum amount. This gives you lots of power in a deal, but sometimes there are places we are desperate to get published and would gladly do so for nothing (only never say that!). In such cases, you just have to own that fact and focus not on the tiny fee but on the side benefits, such as great exposure for your author brand in a prestigious market.Another classic negotiation trick is to get the other person to go first when it comes to naming a number. Their minimum offer might be higher than anything you'd dared imagine, but you'll never know if you blurt your rate first. Often the one who speaks first is the one who is prepared to concede.Be firm and assertive in watching out for your own interests, but always stay polite and professional. You want to write more for this market ideally, and you never know where your opposite number might work next too.Dan Brotzel's debut short story collection, Hotel du Jack, is published by Sandstone"
A practical template to develop Augmented Reality ideas,"The use of Augmented Reality (AR) is getting increasingly popular for a variety of activities, such as marketing campaigns and brand activations. This is due to more smartphones being AR-compatible as well as a number of easy to use software applications that help simplify AR development. Most importantly, it provides a new and exciting way for the public to interact with a brand.My first entry point into AR is when I was at Google designing AR experiences to delight users. There I was introduced to the limitless potential of AR and I was so fascinated by this momentarily glimpse into the future. In my experience designing and developing AR experiences for a number of different clients (commercial and non-commercial), agencies and for my own personal projects, I find myself doodling in my sketchbook, using random arrows to connect things and creating diagrams only I could understand. Hence, I was inspired to create a template to help communicate the AR experience and focusing on how the users can interact with it.This is the template I've come up with:Step 1: Write your project name and goalsIt'll be great to determine a project goal to stay on track with what you're building or be reminded of your intentions for this AR work.Goals such as:Step 2: ""When this happens""This is when the AR app is launched and the camera feed is on. What do you want the user to do first?Examples such as:Step 3: ""This will happen""This is where the main AR magic happens. What do you want it to do after the users have done step 2?There is a lot of inspiration or campaigns companies have done online to get some ideas flowing, I recommend checking out award-winning AR/VR advertising experiences like this. I also added an asset, animation and sound checklist next to it to communicate a clearer idea of how the experience will shape up.Step 4: The ""Transition""""Transition"" means the thing that is going to happen once the user activates the AR experience.Examples of transitions:This is optional or you can simply put ""Automatic"". I put it there because it is the user's first touchpoint with the AR experience and it could be a surprising or delightful experience if done well. Secondly, not a majority of people are used to AR experiences and it'll be great to have more of an onboarding experience.Step 5: The ""Content"" and ""Interaction""""Content"" means information that will be displayed in your AR experiences. This could tie in with your project goals written above. For example, if your project goal is to educate the public about recycling, the content can be about practical ways to recycle.""Interaction"" means the actions that the users would need to do to fully access the AR experience.Examples of interactions:Both of these are optional depending on the experiences you'd like to produce. I've added a dot at the side in case you'd like to link it up to an element you've sketched to avoid excessive text on your drawing.I've tested this template with a group of designers where they were required to propose and present new AR experiences. To provide more examples, I've chosen a few AR projects out there and tried to use the template to communicate it.Example 1: United State Postal Service's 2014 Holiday AR CampaignUnited States postal service made gift giving a more magical experience in their AR marketing holiday campaign. Customers are able to scan their mail and mailboxes outdoor and they would be surprised with a festive holiday animation through a mobile app.Applying the idea with the template:Example 2: OpalAR, AR in public transportationOpalAR is my personal project (shameless plug!) of using an Opal card (Sydney's transport card) to bring up Sydney's train map with AR, inspired by times when I needed to see a train map to check where I am going but there's none around. I'm putting it here because I want to show a variety of AR experiences that is not necessarily for marketing purposes.Applying the idea with the template:Example 3: Absolut Vodka's AR AppAbsolut Vodka used a label tied on their signature bottle to show interactive images of locations in which Absolut cultivates the necessary ingredients to make their vodka through a mobile app. At the back of the label, they showed recipe ideas too.Applying the idea with the template:The graphics of the locations they showed in AR might look 3D but they are actually 2D planes with spacing between them, a neat trick if you want to achieve a 3D look without the complexity of it!This template is for the ideation stage of an AR experience. With this template, it also helps to determine the skills you need to execute it like a 3D designer, animator, specialised developer or sound composer.Download the PDF template hereI hope this template helps you in generating ideas, planning or pitching AR experiences to others! If you've used it, I would love to know what you think or feel free to drop me a message if you have any feedback!Hi, I'm Sarah Tan and I am a Visual Designer based in Sydney, I mainly do product design, graphic design, illustration and AR experiments.

The Definitive Guide to Webinar Sales Funnels for Startups,"As mentioned in ""4 Organic Questions That Move Us Close to Product-Market Fit"", the prerogative for any startup is to be relentless. Relentless in their pursuit to provide value for their customers.However, qualifying leads, responding to emails and meeting ad-hoc requests is incredibly time-consuming. This is even more true if you consider the duration of traditional B2B sales cycles, especially if you are an unknown startup.A small ticket item can take around three months to close, with higher contract values taking about six to nine months. If you're one of many startups who have a limited run rate and need to close customers to raise your next round successfully, you should be seriously considering how you can accelerate your sales funnel. An undervalued tool that any startup can use is the webinar sales funnel.On a high level, a webinar sales funnel enables you to reduce time spent qualifying in, and equally as important, qualifying out prospects.We had an idea to sell internal resources we had developed over the year as a service. Three weeks later, we closed our first sale.We emailed around ~1000 prospects with a free ticket to our webinar. We had 97 sign-ups after two follow up emails. 69 people attended the webinar on the day. 28 engaged in further activities including thank you emails, survey completions and opening a proposal document.We've so far closed a sale worth £3,000, and have another three sales in the pipeline.All you need for a webinar sales funnel is:Given most startups use Google Suite, you're probably already paying for Google Hangouts and 1. is ticked off.To execute, I'm going to assume you have a service you know you want to sell. You also have expertise in the domain. This knowledge is what you'll be providing in the webinar. In exchange for the value you're offering to your prospects, you can plug your startup as the solution.First, create your event on either EventBrite or Universe. You want to use one of these tools because they're free, and allow you to collect money on tickets sold and manage attendees very easily.You're going to need to decide your event title, description, the agenda and any other bits you have to act as social proof.For the event title, go for some variation of [topic of interest] Masterclass Webinar. It's important to communicate; this is a digital event from the go.For the event description, sell the value you're providing, use statistics to provide a strong context.The agenda should be structured as simple bullet points that target customer pain points that the target customer needs and can include a singular point regarding your company and how it is the answer to all problems.Finally, add some social proof. Why is your webinar important? Why are you an authority in this space? Communicate social proof through testimonials, speaker biographies, links to press releases — whatever floats your boat.You're also going to need to create event posters. You don't need to hire an exclusive graphics designer, you can either whip out Photoshop or if you're less inclined — hop on to Google Slides or Powerpoint.Here are some simple posters which you can try to emulate, just copy the color schemes and make it yourself.Just remember you're going to have to create several versions of the poster with dimensions correct for a) the website on which you are hosting the event b) LinkedIn and c) as in-line images in any emails you send.Feel free to use your intuition here. For our event, we created two ticket classes, early-bird and general, priced at £30 and £50. We then created a discount code that gave all the prospects on our mailing list 100% off.There are arguments to even charging your prospects a small token fee. We wanted to maximize our audience given our webinar was an education piece and was a way for us to publicize the rollout of a new service.You're also going to want to use this opportunity to add checkout questions. These can act as great tools to help you qualify prospects. We asked:We then used 4. to help structure the webinar.I'm going to assume you have some sort of mass mailing function — we used Streak since we already had the tool to track our pipelines. There are lots of services, including Yesware and GMass.You're going to send your mailing list three emails. The first one is an invitation, and the second and third are follow-ups.Make sure you don't send follow up emails to prospects who have purchased a ticket.I'm not going to spend a considerable amount of words telling you how to write useful invitation emails, but here are my summarised points.In your second email, repeat the above — but make the email body look different. Here I used a version of the event poster (which was optimized for email dimensions) and pasted it in-line.In the final third email — tell them in the subject line that this is their last reminder. This will reduce the number of unsubscribing prospects and create a sense of urgency.In tandem with emails, your team should be posting the event on Linkedin, and supporting each other's posts with comments and likes. Utilize your poster tailored to LinkedIn's image dimensions! Sharing on LinkedIn will extend the event beyond your initial prospect list and generate entirely new leads.You're going to need to inform all your attendees of the online webinar link after they purchase their tickets. You also want to ensure it's in their calendar, so they don't miss it.Too many webinars fail to communicate their event with their prospects calendar tool smoothly.In my opinion, the best way to do this is to create a calendar invitation for the event. Every night add new attendees as guests to the calendar invitation (which should include joining instructions).This is probably your first time running a webinar. It was ours as well. We organized for a private mock webinar.Send out calendar invites and run the event as if it was the real deal. You may need to delegate tasks, including someone to manually mute attendees as they join. You'll also need to make sure everyone can see the speaker and their screen (if they are going to present a PowerPoint).Make sure your team tries to watch the webinar from non-work emails. Sometimes there may be issues. It's important to simulate every aspect of the event! Finally, make sure everyone provides detailed feedback on the webinar so that it will run smoothly.Email all your attendees, using the inbuilt tool on Universe or Eventbrite, reminding them the event is happening today. Send them the calendar link in case they haven't seen it. Also, tell them you'll be emailing them again 1 hour before the webinar as a short reminder.Numerous emails may seem like overkill, but you want to make sure that your attendees attend your event. You don't want all the hard work to go to waste simply because they forgot.Well done. You've successfully run your webinar — but it's not over yet. Within the day, make sure you send out a thank you email with a link to a survey. The feedback you receive can help shape future engagement with leads. There are lots of free survey tools such as Survey Hero. Don't forget to collect email addresses.You're going to want to use this opportunity also to tell your attendees that you'll be sending out your proposal/services document shortly.Once you've gathered some feedback, you can now send another email. Use the results of your survey to help craft your story. For us, 67% of attendees intend to change their marketing strategy after the webinar, and 30% are planning to increase their budget.These are great metrics to be using while you also send out your proposal document. Make sure you use a tool like DocSend to track who is opening the document.Finally, invite your attendees to a mailing list specifically for SEO.If executed well, you've probably already entered the negotiation stage with some leads. You can now also use all the data you've collected to target prospects specifically.Focus on those that filled out your survey, those who opened your proposal document, and anyone who asked questions during the webinar.Webinars are highly effective sales funnels if used correctly. The key is to provide value and always collect emails and measure interactions."
The Most Under-Appreciated Slide in a Pitch Deck,"The conventional wisdom about startup pitch decks is that the most important sections are the team and money slides. And the conventional wisdom is not wrong. Research shows that investors spend more time on these slides than any others.But having met hundreds of startup entrepreneurs (and their pitch decks), I find I can glean a lot of information about you as an entrepreneur from your competitor slide. Here's what your thoughtful competitive research tells me, as captured in your competitor slide or simply from a conversation with you about your startup's competitive landscape:A comprehensive, detailed list of competitors shows me, first and foremost, that you dig in and do your homework. Competitive research is essentially research into how much of your opportunity has already been seized by others, not a topic most entrepreneurs are passionate about immersing themselves in. Your diligence about competitive research tells me that you're a professional about the less gratifying tasks in an entrepreneur's portfolio. I can also expect other facets of your strategy will be similarly backed up by substance and attention to detail.If you're a startup, by definition you are trying to prove your startup hypothesis. Generally speaking, your hypothesis is that customer demand will scale. If you're really early stage, your hypothesis may be that customer demand exists. Some of the data crossing your desk will be beneficial to your startup hypothesis, and some, such as evidence of a strong competitor, will be detrimental.How do you handle data that doesn't favor your business case? Do you filter it out? Do you bury it? Is your head in the sand (or the clouds)? When you share thoughtful research into your competition, including strengths as well as weaknesses, that's a strong signal the answer is ""no"".There are many bummer days in an entrepreneur's life. The day you say to yourself about the competitor you just looked into, ""Dang, they've actually done a pretty good job of this"" is one of those days. If you've properly identified and acknowledged the competitive pressures facing your startup AND you're still excited about your prospects, that tells me you're more likely to be in it for the long haul. Which is a must for any successful entrepreneur.Entrepreneurs should be able to paint a compelling picture of their startup. I worry if you haven't. But I also worry how much of that picture is embellished.When you acknowledge your competitors' strengths, you give me confidence that you're not trying to put a positive spin on everything. ""We've figured out how to design a smart phone people will want to use, unlike those clowns at Apple and Google"" — not what I want to hear. Unless I've worked with you before, I'm looking for reasons to believe your narrative. Your clear-eyed competitive research is a very good reason.Nobody can be an expert in every domain. Like many others I'm a ""T"" — shallow in a lot of areas, deep in only a few. I'm probably not an expert in your particular niche and its ecosystem at this moment. I bet most investors aren't either. More than your idea or your optimistic financial projections, a few minutes looking into your competitor list gives me a quick education on your space, the opportunity, and your (or anybody's) prospects for success.Even though I'm a technologist, one of my favorite classes in high school was social studies class junior year, where we debated different sides of an argument (often not the side we started out believing). Competitive research is like a pro/con debate on ""I have a great startup idea"". Use it to challenge your assumptions. Your startup strategy and execution, as well as your pitch deck, will be the better for it.This post was originally published on Shulman Rogers NEXT."
Bootstrapping Your Business Is the Most Important Thing You Can Do Right Now,"If ever the was a time to bootstrap your business it's now. Are you bootstrapping your business or just thinking about it?Whether you're a startup or an established firm, bootstrapping your business has lots of benefits.On the other hand, venture capitalists (VCs) have plenty of money to invest. A lot of cash.Is it worth it?Before you get caught up in the dream, read on.Entrepreneurs dream about reinventing, dominating or conquering markets. The one thing that stands in the way of these dreams and making them become a reality is … capital. Or so we think.At this moment Entrepreneurs envision their company accelerating. Growth and profits soar in their mind's eye. The days of struggling, self-financing capital, to just stay afloat, can be a distant memory in the stroke of a pen.The only thing standing in the way is … signing on the dotted line.It's decision time:What to do?From my experience, there is no right or wrong answer.What I do know is that by not bootstrapping your startup, you miss out on experience — valuable life lessons.Business lessons.Lessons that may unlock the biggest self-discovery of your life:Hungry for more? Keep reading.Bootstrapping your business today retains your control for tomorrow.Yes, VCs will tell you that you're better off having a smaller slice of a big cake rather than the whole of a small pie. They'll even tell You that bootstrapping your business will impede growth and profits.Are they right?The answer can be either ""yes"" or ""no"", depending on where you are on your journey.VCs do have a time and place. Somewhere down the line. They have no place at the start or in the middle of your journey.Tasting VC money too early means you have to give up control of your startup. Fact. You have to divide up the pie. A small pie in the early stages.Industry giants today started out bootstrapping their business. Think of Airbnb, Intercom, even Apple or Microsoft.Here's what you could miss out on by selling out too early:Bootstrapping brings one thing to the table that VCs can't:Far too many Entrepreneurs share ownership, relinquishing control of their fledgling startup too soon.If you think VCs have come to the table for a small slice of the pie, so you can retain control, think again.Remember, strings are attached any time you accept money from others. Not that there's anything wrong with this. Arguably, smart money is when you spend other people's money.But at the right time.Operating a thriving startup business is challenging in and of itself. Adding other stakeholders into the mix, with different agendas, ties your hands. You have to deliver their objectives too.Your control is gone. At least in part for now.Control of your company gives you control of your future.Bootstrapping keeps you in the cockpit. In Control.Bootstrapping protects something much more valuable than money. The one thing money can't buy. The thing that allows you to learn, conquer and win in your space.What's this one thing that bootstrapping protects?Bootstrapping your startup keeps your time focused on growing your baby.Chasing external money steals your focus and time away from your startup.Your full-time job becomes something new — meeting with banks, investors, lawyers, and accountants.These investors will want to know how you do what you do. Along the way, you'll spill your ""secret sauce"".It's likely that you'll have the same meetings with lots of different people.Time spent chasing outside finance means that you have less to invest in other things, better things.Like what?Like brainstorming the next problem. Solving or creating market disruption.Time is fixed. An equilibrium. It levels the playing field for all. You can spend time chasing investment or chasing consumers, clients, a key account to grow your business.When you focus on your startup, you acquire clients, grow your business, your market share and increase profits.When you chase outside investment, you do none of the above.Oh, don't be fooled into thinking that when you get outside financing you can refocus on your business again soon thereafter.Nope.Other people's money means rules:Investors want assurances. They want to know exactly what you're doing with their money. Is it protected and is it growing?Weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual reports, presentations and meetings are the trade-offs for external money.You'll drown in financial reports if you're not careful.Creating presentations will consume your time too.At least not yet!Bootstrapping a business isn't easy.Doing what's right rarely is.Bootstrapping your startup though means that your resourcefulness today will feed your offspring tomorrow.Neither solution is perfect. Bootstrapping or external finance.Gains from outside finance is a trade-off with control. Pie-sharing.VCs are always very clear — their money gives you what you need to gain market share to win.VCs aren't shy either. No, they're forthcoming telling you all the things you gain with their money.The same VCs are eerily quiet when you don't deliver, or worse, fail.VCs are in business to win. Period.Don't be surprised that VCs want their money, with interest plus a pound of flesh. Although your sanity will do. All within three to five years.External finance means that VCs, not you, the founder, dictate how your startup grows and exits.Statistically, the likelihood of creating another successful company is slim to none. One that VCs drool over.As I said, doing what's right isn't easy. With your future in mind, bootstrapping a startup is the right thing to do, initially.Bootstrapping gives you one thing that you won't get from VC cash.Control over your startup, your actions, your destiny.Your time.Bootstrapping your startup brings peace-of-mind. VC funding removes peace-of-mind.That said, there are no guarantees in life or business.The same holds true by bootstrapping your business. It brings challenges and risks. That's par for the course, so be prepared to suck it up.But navigating challenges build character, leadership, and a skill that you can only learn by doing — Entrepreneurship.You'll still have sleepless nights. I guarantee that, but bootstrapping your business means that you succeed or fail on your terms.There are no regrets. Period.The choice is yours and always will be. Certainly to begin with.When it comes to building a business, you have one chance to get it right. Of course, you can start again, but you still have one chance with each venture.Don't blow it by selling out too soon.When it comes to starting and running a business, you have a choice. One that determines your future. Your destiny.You either bootstrap or seek outside finance. Neither is perfect, each has downsides.Thousands of entrepreneurs, fall under the VC trance, to their detriment.Bootstrapping instills resilience and resourcefulness, true entrepreneurial traits.As with all things in both life and business, there's a time and a place for everything.So, who are you? Are you an Entrepreneur?Know this — Bootstrapping a startup today sets you up for tomorrow. Your success empowers you to invite external finance on your terms, down the line.Here's the best part — The how, when, where, what and why is up to you? It's in your hands.I know you can do it. Here's to your success.Your Biggest Fan!Paul"
How to adapt your UX for China,"Having started MING Labs in China in 2011, we have seen a big development from the old-internet world of overladen landing pages, to digital products of world-class defining design today. In parallel, we have seen the move from clunky desktop applications with small user bases, to the mobile-first B2C revolution to the rise of the super apps that are the new all-encompassing ecosystems in the market.Throughout those major shifts in digital products and behaviors, some preferences have remained constant that differ from those in Western markets. Understanding what is actually different, and what is just a different stage of development, is an important factor when launching your product in the market. From key differences in UX requirements, to the preference for larger ecosystems and a different understanding of value, China is unique in many aspects (as are other markets, to be sure).Over the years, we have helped many startups and MNCs to launch their products, built and validated in their home markets, into the Chinese market.This article is therefore mainly aimed at those thinking about, tasked with or actively working on expanding into the Chinese market, and who are wondering what that means for their digital products and services.When launching in a new market that has some important dissimilarities from your home market, essentially you have three choices in product adaptation:The trade-off here is that with an increasing China customization you are reducing your Economies of Scale, as a very localized business will not be scalable into other markets and will need a lot of local, dedicated resources, whose learning you can't leverage in your global expansion. At the same time, a low level of customization will stay highly scalable, yet might not yield success as it is a very specific market.That trade-off and decision is by no means trivial. Finding a good answer typically requires taking on a beginner's mindset (going back to the Exploration stage) and first testing your product and value proposition locally.In the next parts, we will assume that you have come to your conclusion and you are opting for a Localized approach (as Minimal is straight-forward and China Business goes to Business Design). What exactly then are the differences in UX design and local platforms you should be aware of and adapt to?Some of the preferences in design and interaction are rooted in the Chinese culture. There are few things to be aware of that make a big difference:The cultural differences manifest in different preferences regarding UX and service design, which produce the services you see on the Chinese internet today. While they often have Western inspirations or counterparts, they work differently in some key aspects. Including:These are a few guiding principles to consider when redesigning your digital experience for China. Driven by cultural differences, these are expectations that exist with consumers today towards any product or service.Any thoughts on product adaptations for China would be incomplete without the considerations of local platforms — first and foremost super apps. These are applications owned by the biggest ecosystem players in China (Alibaba, Meituan, Tencent), which aggregate many different services into one touchpoint, offer foundational layers of identity and payments to tie them together, and allow for third parties to write small applications that can be pulled into that powerful context.As their platforms essentially monopolize consumer attention across verticals, the companies owning them generally let new trends play out, invest in them and later buy them out. Therefore, creating larger and larger kingdoms that lock in consumers. They are therefore a great distribution channel and are very open to partner with and enable new entrants. It also means that without them, you are facing a heavy up-hill battle.Of course, there are trade-offs to be aware of. Where on Amazon you run the risk of the marketplace introducing their own brand of products to price you out, Alibaba essentially owns the consumer and their data, with a stark indifference to who wins the battle for their wallet. If you enter with a novel product, Chinese competitors will soon copy you and there is no one to protect you from it.In terms of platforms, probably everyone is more or less familiar with WeChat and Alipay. Some of the key ecosystems that are open to a degree to integrate with. The way to get in there, except for acquisition, are mini programs. This is a rising trend of apps-in-apps that are becoming very important for business.Mini programs account for the majority of customer interaction already in all major consumers verticals. They have only really been launched in their current shape about over a year ago but are taking over quickly . They are becoming entry points into engagement with brands — from shared content, over quick entry to the official accounts. Mini programs are the new beachhead to customer interaction.They are not great for retention. Usually they underperform other owned touchpoints, such as native apps and web applications, in terms of retention. Tencent has invested a lot of effort to make them stickier and they are improving already. With high barriers to get people to install native apps though, Mini Programs are a great entry point to then lead people over to install native apps.Mini programs are ideal for simple and low frequency use cases. Entry is easy, retention is low. Yet they are powerful at mitigating media breaks and reducing friction. So, identifying the right use case is key. Like order to the table at a restaurant. The more complex or frequent a use case is, the stronger the need for an app or web app.Competition is happening at a breakneck pace, with today's lauded innovation being the next spectacular failure tomorrow. To successfully launch into this environment, it is paramount to keep an explorer's mindset, be aware of underlying foundational differences and iterate quickly. And to keep iterating and adapting even after a successful launch, as the market and the customers will keep moving on, in a country where change has been the only constant for decades.If you have any thoughts, responses or questions to add, I would love to hear from you in the comments below, or feel free to reach out to me directly via LinkedIn.

Acknowledging the Emotional Labor of Being the Boss,"The story below is from a time in my career 20 years ago, long before we were in the grips of the current global Covid-19 pandemic. I'm sharing it now because I thought it might help managers who are struggling with the emotional labor of being the boss.I described this story in the section of Radical Candor about why caring personally about each employee is central to your job as a leader. That is more true now than ever before.Showing compassion is real work, and, like all real work, it is rewarding and also taxing. All over the world, leaders are being called upon to listen to stories that are hard to hear and to respond to emotions that are hard to witness.Caring for others starts with caring for yourself. Don't beat yourself up if you're feeling burned out. Give yourself the break you need. You can't possibly Care Personally about others if you don't care about yourself!In 2000, our engineers had been working nights and weekends on an early beta version of our product, which would be ready in a week. The sales team had gotten 30 big-name customers lined up for beta testing. If those customers were using our product, we'd be able to raise another round of funding. If not, we'd run out of money in six months.There was one blocker: me. The night before, one of our angel investors, Dave Roux, had told me he thought our pricing was all wrong. I knew in my gut Dave was right, but I couldn't go to my sales team or my board and change everything just based on a gut feeling. I needed to sit down and do some analysis — fast. I'd cleared my calendar of meetings for the morning so I could do just that.I'd gotten only a few steps into the office when a colleague suddenly ran up. He needed to talk right away. He had just learned that he might need a kidney transplant, and he was completely freaked out. After an hour and two cups of tea, he seemed calmer.I walked toward my desk, past an engineer whose child was in the ICU. Must check in. ""How'd your son do last night?"" I asked. He hadn't improved — and as he told me how the night had gone we both had tears in our eyes. I convinced him to leave the office and go and take care of himself for an hour before returning to the hospital.I left his desk drained, passing by our quality assurance manager. His child had better news: she'd just received the highest score in the entire state on a standardized math test. He wanted to talk about it. I felt emotional whiplash as I jumped from sympathy to celebration. This kind of emotional labor — feeling the need to suppress my emotions for the good of the organization — left me feeling completely wrung out.By the time I got back to my desk, I had no time or emotional reserves to think about pricing. I cared about each of these people, but I also felt worn out — frustrated that I couldn't get any ""real"" work done. Later that day, I called my CEO coach, Leslie Koch, to complain.""Is my job to build a great company,"" I asked, ""or am I really just some sort of emotional babysitter?""Leslie, a fiercely opinionated ex-Microsoft executive, could barely contain herself. ""This is not babysitting,"" she said. ""It's called management, and it is your job!""Every time I feel I have something more ""important"" to do than listen to people, I remember Leslie's words: ""It is your job!"" I've used Leslie's line on dozens of new managers who've come to me after a few weeks in their new role, moaning that they feel like ""babysitters"" or ""shrinks.""We undervalue the emotional labor of being the boss. But this emotional labor is not just part of the job; it's the key to being a good boss.That being said, it's important to recognize that being the boss can be exhausting during the best of times, and during times of crisis, it can feel downright paralyzing. If you don't identify ways to take care of your emotional, physical and mental health, you won't be able to be there for anyone else.A 2018 study published in the Yonsei Medical Journal reported that the sustained stress of emotional labor can quickly lead to burnout, psychological distress and depression. Now more than ever, it's important to find ways to manage that stress — to take care of yourself so you can lead your team through uncertainty. This means knowing what you need to stay centered and making sure you make time for it.Since that day in 2000, I have learned to focus first on staying centered myself, so that I could build real relationships with each of the people who work for me. Only when I am centered and my relationships are strong can I fulfill my responsibilities as a manager to guide my team.It's also OK to admit that you don't have all the answers. However, when you do have information that affects your team, commit to delivering it as soon as possible in a way that's kind and clear.Things are difficult right now, and there's no doubt that it might get worse before it gets better. This is why it's more important than ever to be kind and clear, not only with the people you work with, but with yourself.Read more in Radical Candor: Fully Revised & Updated Edition: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity, e-book and audio version available."
"Why you shouldn’t expand your market, but narrow it down","An ailment I see at a lot of startups is something I'd call ""new-product-itis"". Symptoms include: wanting to build a new product, expand to new geographies or into new industries. Severe cases include several symptoms at the same time — and I've suffered from it.Creating new products or expanding into new markets seems like the kind of thing-a-company-should-be-doing. However, in many, many cases, this is a bad idea. In fact, here's a rule of thumb: if you are fewer than 10 people, you should not have more than one product, one market, one industry. If you're around 50, it starts being something you may want to consider — but by no means a surefire hit.In many cases, the value of remaining in a narrow market makes intuitive sense. Let's take an example: who makes more money between 1) a neurosurgeon and 2) a general practitioner?Let's add a third category: who makes more money between a 2) general practitioner and a 3) general practitioner who also does web design?It seems clear for everyone that 1 will make more than 2, who will themself make much more than 3, even though a naive analysis could indicate that the total addressable market is the largest for the physician-cum-web-designer.Of course, considering the size of the market is not really helpful in this case. While more people have health problems than brain problems, the neurosurgeon brings a critical and specialized help for those who do, and is able to charge more for her service.This intuition seems to break down when we stop thinking about people and start thinking about companies: there, larger feels like better. But that's not true, and there are two main benefits of keeping a narrow focus.When you advertise something to a narrow market, your target audience will immediately know if it's something for them or not. Your value will be clear to them, and depending on how that market perceives you, you will know whether you're on the right track or not.Of course, the many people outside of your target market will see that what you do is not right for them. But you don't care about them: focus on your core market.That's something even the largest companies understand: Nestlé rarely sells under its name but operates thousands of brands which can each have a message targeted to their audience: from Nespresso to affluent middle-aged professionals to Purina for pet owners or Nescafé for people who like to live in misery.Different geographies have different cultural norms which will translate in different sales strategies — not to mention different languages for your product. Different customer sizes will not have the same requirements. Early in my last company, Teleport, we had decided that we would be B2B, selling to large enterprise accounts. This changed completely our development roadmap: out were things like credit card processing, since our customers would be settling few, large bills. In were security audits and stuff like single sign-on.With that in mind, if you try to juggle all of your markets, you will end up with a half-baked product for each one of them. How could it be any different, since by definition a startup has resources to do only a tiny fraction of what is on its radar?As Sam Altman from Y Combinator said in his great How to Start a Startup lecture:One other thing that Sam Altman doesn't say is that if you create something some people love, they will also have a much higher tolerance to any bugs or shortcomings with your product. They will stick with you and help you make it better. No one who just ""likes"" something ever does anything like that.Do the previous points make sense? I hope they do. They usually do. But they are usually not enough to convince anyone that they should stay focused. People will find reasons why in their particular case, the alternative approach is the one that makes sense. I hear three main counterarguments that need to be addressed right now:First of all, if you are a 5-people start-up, any market is large enough. Anywhere you can get half a million per year, you can survive. But you want to grow, right? And you need to show your investors that you're going to conquer a billion-dollar market? That's fine. Explain in your pitch how your initial, small market, will allow you to understand and expand into a much bigger one. Explain how your laser focus in the beginning will allow you to create the best product in the industry. If that's still not enough, remind whoever you're talking to that Mark Zuckerberg started by making a social network only for Harvard students.I get that. You have an idea, a hundred possible applications, how can you pick one and say no to the others? That's bound to generate massive FOMO.So you'll have to do something drastic…You'll have to go talk to your target audience.And they don't even have to be actual users of your product, they just have to be people in your target market. Talk to them. Ask them how they work, what their problems are, what they need. Pitch them your product. Ask them to test some early prototypes. And then get the feedback.This is qualitative research so you will never be ""done"". Time-box it, get insights, iterate on your idea, and then test it again. If need be keep repeating, as a mantra, that picking any market is better than picking none of them.This is the most challenging one, and it comes from the availability bias. At every stage, you will compare your company not to relevant competitors, but to the most visible ones. The most visible companies are very large. Very large companies have different imperatives than you do.You should be comparing your 5-people start-up to other 5-people start-ups, and not to 50'000-people juggernauts, but you can't do that because 5-people start-ups tend to be invisible.So just try to keep in mind that a company like Facebook both needs to address several markets, because none of them is large enough on their own, and that they have the resources to do it. You don't. But even companies like Facebook started laser focused on a small and apparently insignificant market. So for the moment, just don't ask yourself ""What would Facebook do?""As your company progresses, in its early stages (let's say until you hit 20–50 employees or so), your value proposition should become more and more complex and narrow.For instance, you may start with some experience with web analytics or a hunch that it's a domain that is lacking something. So your early value proposition will be very broad.You can't operate with that. Lots of companies are in that space, with complete and advanced products: you won't be able to come out and compete with the Mixpanels and Amplitudes of this world. So you have to narrow down.Talk. To. Users.Talk to users. There's no way about it. Talk to as many people as you can, representing as many different industries. You will discover things. Perhaps you will discover that large companies already have analytics solutions in place, but that small companies are struggling. That's great. Here is your new value proposition.Ok, but small companies are still very broad. In the US a company of up to 500 employees still qualifies as ""small"". And they also represent lots of different industries, each one with more or less to gain from web analytics. So talk to more people, and you'll come up with more insight, and with a new version:That's good. You now know you're targeting retailers, and you aren't interested by the ones selling through Ebay or Amazon.Going forward, you will keep refining your value proposition until you reach something really, really narrow. I'm thinking out loud here:Does that VP make sense? I have no idea. Probably not. But then again I'm part of the general audience regarding that: I don't operate an online store. Chances are that whatever truly valuable idea you come up with will look weird to anyone but your target audience. But if you did your job correctly, your target audience will love it.So then you can go pitch these clients. You won't be wasting time talking with larger companies or people selling through Ebay. And you won't be sending them weak-ass messages promising ""web analytics"": you will be able to tell them ""hey, I know you have a problem of spending money on search terms only to have the carts get abandoned. I can solve that"". If you identified a real problem people will react to it.Think again about the bad reasons for not going that path. Wanting to keep your market as large as possible is going to lead you to try to do too many different things at the same time, thereby not doing any of them well. You will never know what market is the best but it doesn't really matter, as long as you have a clear focus and find a valuable proposition for them. And don't compare yourself to what the largest companies in the world are doing: their example is not relevant.When you have found your tiny little niche, you will be able to sell to it efficiently, you will be generating revenue and, more critically, you will be getting with each passing day additional insights into your market. You will then be able to expand into neighboring markets, other industries, etc. But leave that for when you have exhausted the potential of your tiny starting market — but that's a story for a different time.About meI'm a product manager, 500 Startups alumnus, consultant.I'm program manager at a growth company and consult on product management in large companies and start-ups alike.The rest of the time, I read random books and cook vast amounts of food.Connect with me through my website, Twitter, LinkedIn."
The roles and responsibilities of a startup CEO and its founding team,"After three years of running my startups and advising various new ventures, I have learned the hard way — mainly from mistakes and failures — that there is a direct link between the founders' leadership skills and the success of their startups. A capable and strong startup CEO and its founding will need two different skills sets to deliver success:As managers, a startup CEO and founding team need to perform five sets of circular and repetitive activities:While in established and mature companies, these cycles can be monitored and checked quarterly, in a startup, this needs to happen on a weekly or bi-weekly basis because a startup is functioning under a great number of hypotheses and unknowns and therefore needs to be continuously be learning and making small or large pivots.While managerial activities are more mechanical, leadership is more soft skills and harder to acquire and execute. A CEO and founding team's leadership tasks can be summarized under three main buckets:Leadership is tough to execute because a CEO can not achieve it by just speaking it — it needs to be behaved and presented in action. Leadership depends on the example that a CEO or the founding team set themselves as to the values they want their company to be run by and if they're not going to behave based on those values, it will most likely fail.Becoming a successful startup CEO and founding team, is a difficult. It requires patience, constant learning from mistakes, and adaptation to new circumstances."
Finding the Right Role in Tech,"This post is not meant for those looking to enter engineering or people management roles.When you click into the ""open roles"" tab on a tech company job page, you may at first be overwhelmed by the sheer number of niche positions. Which one should you apply to? Or should you simply apply to all of them and see which ones extend an interview? Maybe you somehow know you want to go into, let's say, product. But is this the right role for you?Over the past few years, I worked across both the business and product sides of tech, which gave me a holistic view of how these teams interact with each other and what the benefits are for each. I've had countless phone calls with classmates, colleagues, friends and acquaintances who have reached out asking about which role they should choose or whether they would enjoy working on a certain team.It's stressful thinking about what job to pursue — who wants to get stuck in role they don't like?These conversations, as well as my personal feedback from past managers and mentors, sparked me to share my insights such that others can benefit as well.When I started my senior year in college, I was constantly irritated thinking about which roles to apply to. Most of my classmates flocked to finance and consulting jobs, which never really appealed to me. The e-commerce venture I had started in college renewed my entrepreneurial spirit, and I was determined to get a job in tech. Since many of my peers didn't share the same sentiment, there were few people I could go to for advice.I went into the industry blind. At that time, I optimized for acquiring as many diverse skillsets as possible to start my own venture again (which I would realize later is not my goal).Over four years, I would work as a data scientist, a product manager, a business strategy associate, and a growth manager (on both the product and marketing sides). I joined two companies pre-IPO (Dropbox and Lyft) and witnessed both companies change after the public offering. I've taken on a new role almost every year, which is not very common within tech, and it taught me a lot about the functions of each role, as well as its merits and limitations.Keep in mind that roles are unique to that company, and each company is different. For example, a growth position at Lyft may not operate the same as a growth position at Facebook, and a growth position at a startup is like a foreign planet compared to the other two.Before you decide to take on a role, it's important to ask the hiring manager which projects and/or products you would be held responsible for. What you own inside a company will vastly influence your experience.Here I've summarized the high-level merits, limitations, and skills gained for four roles across business and product. It's a reflection of my personal take on the roles, and hence, you should also form your own judgement based on your preferences.Finding the best fit may take time, and it's okay to engage in some trial and error. Even after four roles (or five, if you count my time working on economics research within tech), I am still on a quest to find the role that I want to dedicate the next few decades towards. But so far, I'm enjoying the learning journey across different teams and am very grateful for the opportunity to do so.There is no wrong role — every role will teach you something new, and as cliche as this sounds, it's the learning process (about the job and yourself) that really matters. Depending on who you are, here's some recommendations on how to approach roles:a) A college grad looking to enter techHere are some examples of what my colleagues in other industries have switched from:I'm only speaking to the roles I've personally worked in. There are plenty of other roles within tech that not covered in this post (e.g., FP&A, product design, product marketing, user research, partnerships, and so forth).Good luck, and hopefully this adds a bit of color to your role search!For more posts like this, you can subscribe to me on substack or my website and follow me on twitter."
How To Start a Six-Figure Website This Year,"In 2013, I was out of work and had a lot of time on my hands. When I wasn't taking care of my daughter, who was a baby at the time, I spent my mornings and evenings studying SEO and content marketing, and I accidentally started an online business. It took a while for that site to translate into earnings, but it eventually paid off.I didn't predict a recession in 2020, but I was more prepared for it than previous ones. I built up a reserve of cash in my business that will hopefully see me through the next few months.I've learnt the hard way not to depend too much on one source of income.If you haven't started an online business yet, now is an ideal time to start. Over the past few months, I've studied or interviewed successful niche website owners like Canadian lawyer Jon Dykstra.During the early 2000s, he faced a unique challenge.His employer wanted him to attract more clients through blogging and content marketing. So Dykstra began writing about legal topics that interested clients, based on their search queries.He says,Inspired by how content marketing helped grow the practice, Dykstra began building niche websites on the side.When these niche sites began attracting website traffic and earning revenue, he found balancing a law career with an online one more challenging.""Eventually you're forced to choose. It's hard to do both. I seemed to like the blogging side and the writing online more and opted to go that route,"" Dykstra says.He quit the practice, where he was a partner, in 2012 to focus on growing niche websites full time. A niche site typically focuses on a single subject like sports cars and attracts traffic through high-quality articles optimised for search. A hyper-niche site dives down into a topic even further.He told me,Dykstra grows his niche websites by publishing in-depth articles about specific topics, at scale. Dykstra relies on agencies to supply much of his content, something that forms a significant chunk of his monthly overhead. He also recently hired a content strategist.""I liken content to a widget. If you're in manufacturing, you produce widgets. If you're an online publisher, you produce content. And so yes, there are multiple workflows. I have a couple of in-house writers that I work with,"" he says.Today, Dykstra runs nine profitable niche sites, but he doesn't disclose their URLs. He also started several more niche and hyper-niche sites over the years. Some of these sites haven't taken off, while others represent long-term bets.""Several of them are very small and don't do anything. I call them my rainy day sites. I publish maybe one, two, three articles a month on them,"" he says. ""I don't expect them to do well, but I like to have some aged sites with some good content sitting there in case down the road I get some time and some more resources.""Considering the potential return of a niche site, it's tempting for an aspiring entrepreneur to start several sites at once and hope for the best. However, Dykstra offers this warning,Running more than one site also presents additional technical challenges and issues. For example, if a WordPress plugin breaks on a site, the owner will probably have to fix the same issue across all of their sites. Similarly, investing in high-quality content for multiple sites at once could become a huge expense with no immediate returns.It takes many months if not years of hard work before an online publisher will see a proper return on a niche site project. Ranking highly in Google search results requires a significant amount of quality articles or backlinks. Domain age and authority are important factors too. Changes to the Google search algorithm also present business risks.""These things don't happen in six months. The growth takes a long time unless you get very, very lucky, or you really know what you're doing. I can't make them happen in six months,"" says Dykstra. ""You don't want to pull the plug early, but at the same time you don't want to just keep throwing money at something that has absolutely no future.""Dykstra is running a profitable business built around publishing. His success isn't unique though. The Wirecutter is the most high-profile example of a successful niche site. It focused almost entirely on Amazon product reviews and Amazon bought the site in 2016 for over $30 million.For anyone interested in creating content, a niche site represents a profitable career opportunity.

Why the Internet Is a Mixed Bag for Writers,"Welcome to The Draft, an advice column about writing and life from Eileen Pollack, former director of the University of Michigan MFA Program. We're here to answer your questions about storycraft, writing, and telling the truth.Have a question? Share it with us.Dear Too Young,I'm not sure anyone younger than 50 can appreciate how profoundly the internet has changed the way writers write. Until the late 1990s, every time you were stymied by a fact, you needed to consult your 32-volume Encyclopedia Britannica, which most writers were too poor to own, or dash off to a library, where you spent hours roaming around a reference room, then begging the librarian to pitch in and help.Tracking down clues about a historical event or a person's life meant you needed to raise the money to travel to whatever institution stored the archives. If you were trying to jog your memory about your family's trip to the 1964 World's Fair in Flushing, New York, you might leaf through your mother's scrapbook, but you couldn't spend an afternoon on YouTube disappearing into video after video of the same exhibits you visited as a child.I bless the internet every day for making my life as a writer so much easier. As much as I wish my publishers didn't push me to promote my books on social media, I am grateful for the audience I otherwise might never reach. At best, a few thousand readers might see an essay I publish in the print version of a literary journal, while tens of thousands — or even millions — might read an article that goes viral online.Amazon threatens to put bookstores out of business. But thanks to online shopping, people who don't live near bookstores can buy or download my publications. Facebook, Twitter, Medium, and other sites I am too old and tired to keep up with provide venues for writers who traditionally would have been ignored or silenced. While the internet is a home for every rumor, lie, and crackpot theory a paranoid stoner might dream up, many print publications didn't have the resources to employ fact-checkers either. Sources have always varied in credibility—that's why teachers try to instill the skills necessary to read critically and evaluate an author's credentials.And yet, I hate the way Facebook and Twitter have turned me into a shill constantly trying to push my products. Even when I post something seemingly unrelated to a new book or column, I am posting that photo of my trip to Greece or that account of my misadventure at the dry cleaner's so my friends won't think the only time I post is when I'm trying to sell my work.In the old days, a writer mailed off a manuscript to an editor, at which marketing the essay or book fell to the company's publicity department. Now, creating a literary work is seamlessly connected to promoting it. Right from the start, when we ought to be listening to our hearts, our minds, and our imaginations, we're already thinking about how to get more views.Some writers intentionally stake out extreme or contrarian positions to shock their readers. Others quiver in fear of unleashing a firestorm of threats from trolls. In the early 1980s, when I was a columnist for a newspaper in New Hampshire, I might publish a piece that drew 10 or 20 hateful letters to the editor. (Often, these came printed in block capitals on yellow legal paper or scrawled on a bag in crayon.) I might get an earful when I tried to cash a check and the salesperson saw my name. But I didn't need to worry that thousands of strangers would clamor for me to be raped or crucified.Nor did I live in fear that I might ruin my career by professing a view that wasn't sufficiently progressive. Believe me, I am not railing against ""political correctness."" When I started teaching, students ran too great a risk to hand in stories with queer protagonists, let alone come out to their classmates. Writers of color tended to populate their fiction with white, middle-class characters to avoid the pain that typically arose when stories featuring characters who looked like them were discussed in workshop. A student or professor could make a hurtful comment with little fear of repercussions. I have no desire to return to those stifling decades. And yet, when I teach nonfiction now, my students seem so afraid of offending anyone, especially members of their own community, they sometimes refrain from telling the truth about their lives.In the old days, anonymity provided comfort. I could write about a classmate from elementary school, a distant relative, or a former lover, and I wasn't likely to hear back from anyone, if only because few of my childhood friends, relatives, or former lovers read the obscure literary journals in which I published. Now? My third-grade classmates, distant cousins, and former lovers will read what I have written online and respond immediately.On the positive side, my increased timidity is balanced by the pressure to be more responsible. Is my account of that childhood incident strictly factual or have I embellished it? Did I bother to get in touch with that former lover and ask about their side of our argument? In writing about my eating disorder or my position on pornography, did I take into account the most likely opposing arguments? Have I considered all the data? Am I clinging to outmoded views? Should I modify my opinions? Or should I stand up for what I believe and take the flak? By forcing me to pay more attention to the consequences, social media has made me — for better and worse — more circumspect than I once might have been.The internet and digital media also have influenced the quality of our prose. An entire book can now be researched, written, and edited without anyone needing to print out a hard copy, which means the writer never gets to notice the awkward sentences and wordy passages that become apparent only when viewed on the printed page.The first writers who tried to earn a living online were bloggers, and blogs were meant to feel conversational. When I tried to write as carefully, as lyrically, as thoughtfully as I might have written when composing an essay for a journal, my readers made me feel as if I had arrived in a cocktail dress and heels at a backyard kegger. The virtual world seems to offer an infinite amount of (cyber)space in which a piece of creative nonfiction can unfurl, but people who are reading on a computer, let alone a phone, seem less likely to want to keep scrolling than people who settled into their easy chair with a book.Everything seems so ephemeral: what we write doesn't physically exist, so we don't feel we are writing for posterity. In the past, someone writing for a magazine might have been a member of the staff, poorly paid but with a salary. Now we dash off our essays and posts more quickly, trying to earn a few clicks — and dollars — before the public's attention drifts to the next crisis, trend in fashion, or hot new restaurant. (As I edit this column, which I wrote before the pandemic hit, I feel the pressure to make it seem relevant to coronavirus. And yet, that very pressure is one of the differences between the era in which I grew up and the one in which I now find myself writing and trying to earn a living.)Often this means we write what we already know, or think we know, because otherwise, we would need to leave the apartment and do some research in the real world, which feels scarier and more expensive. Do you join the chorus of complaints about people hoarding toilet paper during the current crisis, or do you drive out to Costco to interview the people who are filling their carts with Charmin and ask them why? We fall into easy patterns, finding someone we can call out and criticize, deploring the absurdities we have discovered elsewhere on the web. We share whatever wisdom we have acquired about how to date, how to escape a relationship, how penises or vaginas function.Much of this discourse has been liberating and/or enlightening. We know far more about our bodies than most of us used to know. We feel less ashamed of our secret habits. But hasn't everything that previously seemed unmentionable already been mentioned by now? Does anyone really think they know more about dating than anyone else? Can't we foresee a time when trading our most humiliating anecdotes will seem ho-hum?Even I have fallen into the trap of writing what I already know — advice about living as a writer — rather than going out and doing some new investigative research. But I have an excuse — I am exhausted from all the research I did in my first four decades as a writer. You have no excuse, Too Young. Go out and visit someplace you've never been, even if it's only the tiny town across the river. Rather than emailing the subject of your interview a list of questions, why not spend a day with them and structure your profile around whatever they do that's interesting? Or come up with a mystery that truly puzzles you, then try to solve it.Walking around a new physical place, opening the dusty boxes in an archive and paging through a diary or a sheaf of census forms can reveal far more than viewing that location or those documents on your computer. Did you notice the way the ink on those census forms kept running out? Can you imagine the poor census-taker going door-to-door in a Brooklyn slum in the late 1800s, perhaps fearing he might contract cholera or tuberculosis, trying to pry information from suspicious immigrants, many of whom didn't speak English, even as he needed to find a place to set down his inkwell and refill his pen?Have a question about writing?

Deadlines Are the Best Thing Since Sliced Bread,"If you read the headline of this article and finished the thought with ""…said no one ever, "" this one is definitely for you.I suppose I used to feel the same way. Having entered college thinking I wanted to be a journalist, I quickly learned the importance of a deadline. But at the same time, unless something immediately pressing was happening in the world, deadlines felt sort of arbitrary.""They're just trying to be in control"", is what my non-conformist, all-knowing, early 20-something self would think about anyone who put my work on a deadline. This was true for any sort of job or assignment I crossed paths with. Even when I was waiting tables, being told I had 10 minutes to deliver someone their lunch made me tingle with frustration. How dare they interrupt my day with their urgency?Fast-forward to me launching my own copywriting business, and my opinion of deadlines changed quickly and dramatically. Here's what shifted my mindset.In the beginning, when clients would book a call with me, I would always get excited. ""They want to work with me!""Then I learned the real question is ""do I want to work with them?""One sure-fire indicator that I don't want to touch a project with a 10-foot pole is ""oh, you know, we have the idea but there's no pressure to hurry.""Their deadline apathy tells me a few things.Zero thought about a project timeline is my queue to tell them they may not be ready to work with me yet. I'm a copywriter, not a business coach.Being willing and receptive to recognizing this saves me my biggest asset. Time. And that brings me to my next point.I have, admittedly, accepted projects with those willy-nilly deadlines a few times. I have, admittedly, suffered the scope creep-slash-rape that comes along with it.It all starts out innocently enough.""We don't want you to stress yourself out!""""There's no rush!""""Take your time.""Meanwhile…""Oh hey, I know it's Saturday and we don't want to overload you, but we really need this email to go out Monday morning because…""And I'm caught deciding between canceling my weekend camping trip and telling them every client's favorite word. No.Or, ""we're not really in a hurry to get this up so we'll give you our feedback next week.""And I'm caught staring at the block of time I reserved in my calendar to review their feedback and make edits when I could have filled it with another project or client call.Despite any safeguards you may have in your business to convey your project process and timeline to your clients, some won't comprehend it and you'll have to break it down 17 different was until it clicks. Others will completely disregard it because some people always think they're entitled to be the exception.In reality, the only one who decides the exception is the one behind the wheel of your business: you.So remember this: deadlines give you freedom. Set them and honor them so you can live your best damn life, or whatever the kids are saying these days.If you do get caught in the habit of accepting wishy-washy client work, here's some good news: you can break the cycle by implementing deadlines.Imagine a drain has clogged in your home. You try the usual drugstore fixes, but nothing works so you call a plumber. They tell you their rates, and you agree. When they show up, they take a look at the issue. Then they ask you how long it should take them to fix it.You're not the expert in the situation, so how should you know? Time to hire a new plumber.The same is true in any business. Serious clients who truly need your skills want to see that you have a system to deliver their work on time and that you have some idea of how long it's going to take.Yes, some clients will be busy and barely give you enough of a brief to get started, and reading their feedback will be like trying to decipher ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. But others will have some idea of what the process should look like, and if you aren't ready for that, it's quickly going to become clear to them that your services are amateur hour.If you don't have a project timeline, develop one. Do this for each of your services. It doesn't have to be fancy. It could be a simple Google doc or pdf that explains how and when you get started, how and when you provide edits, and how and exactly when the final work will be delivered. What matters is that the client knows when they're going to get what they paid for.Even better than delivering work on time is delivering work early. When you're your own boss, there's no real reason that you shouldn't give yourself a nice, long project timeline to make this possible. Double or triple how long you think the project will take you so you have plenty of time to make yourself look great with an early delivery.I'll save the Honor Your Deadlines speech, because I have, in fact, pushed back deadlines. I hope someday I never have to, but for now, if I change a deadline, I follow these 2 rules:In my experience, moving a deadline has been due to new information or current events. If a new study came out that will strengthen an article significantly, or a global pandemic makes their email campaign feel insensitive, I wouldn't feel right delivering the work as-is. Never has a client been unsatisfied with hearing ""I'm looking out for you.""I haven't had any personal emergencies get in the way of making deadlines, but if I did, I would make sure they were aware of the situation without burdening them with too many details. Clients don't need to know the nuances of sick dogs or car accidents. They just need to know what it means when it comes to them receiving the work they paid for without. Leaving out the sob story shows you respect their time.The magic of this approach is that when you respect their time, they're more likely to respect yours.As a writer or creative, deadlines come with the territory. Will there be days where you're guzzling coffee and taking your meals hunched over your keyboard? Absolutely. But that's a whole lot better than getting caught in a cycle of attracting low-paying clients who expect you to put your life on hold at their every whim. That's a surefire way to prevent yourself from reaching your goals for many years to come.The moral of the story? Your time is money. Use deadlines to help you budget accordingly."
How to Deal With Beginner Anxiety as a New Freelance Writer,"There comes a point for most new freelance writers where they know the action steps they need to take, but they are still cemented by fear.They love to write, but they are worried that others won't want to pay them for their words.If you feel this way, know that you aren't alone. However, you do need to kick this fear and anxiety out of your business ASAP. Here are a few tips to help.Not sure what to pitch or write for a new freelance writing client? Research their site and answer these questions:Knowing these answers and reading through several articles on a potential client's website can help you feel more confident in your abilities. If your freelance client is new to the content marketing world, this is when you ask them to provide a few sites or articles they love.It is also good to know what their content goals are. For example, if they want to develop core content that is trustworthy, then adding trendy verbiage and Buzzfeed-style title is not a good idea.Fear of failing use to cripple me from pursuing goals. Then I started thinking logically. What is the worst that can happen to me in this situation?Most of the time was that I would be embarrassed or I would get rejected. These feelings are crushing at the time, but they aren't life-altering. If a client does not like my article, then worst that can happen is that they don't pay me, I have wasted time, and my ego is bruised.If your article is horrible, no one is going to take your kids away, burn down your house, or stop being your friend. This may seem silly, but the truth is that we put too much weight on failing and rejection in the business world.Here is what will likely happen if your article is not great. Either the client will ask you to rework it and then be satisfied with the changes or they will tell you that your tone isn't right for their company, and most of the time, they will pay you for your work.They aren't going to be calling up all of their to spread your name around or leave you a bad Yelp review.Their rejection is either a reflection that you need to tweak your writing or that you just weren't a great fit for the client. It doesn't mean you can't succeed in freelance writing.The point of asking what the worst that can happen isn't to put your mind in a negative space. Instead, it is to show you that the worst in your situation is not that bad at all. You can bounce back from rejection and criticism.Now think about what the best situation that can happen from this one article. The cool thing about this exercise is that the sky is the limit. You really have no idea how far one article or client can take you.Anxiety as a freelance writer usually comes from the desire to write an amazing article from the beginning. The best articles are not penned on the first draft. It can take several rounds of self-edits to get a piece where you want it.Instead of wasting time trying to come up with the best lede, just throw something on the page. Get the article written and then go back and make the tweaks you want.It is hard to polish a table when you haven't built it yet. The same principle applies to writing. You can't start the editing and refining process if the words and ideas are still stuck in your head.Many times you will find your article's tone or direction in the middle of the article rather than the beginning. This is why it is better to get your writing out than hemming and hawing over each word. Don't miss my post on getting started when you've never been published before.So start acting like it. William Zinsser said that writing is a craft much like that of a plumber. You get better at your job by doing it. You get better at writing by writing.There is no need to have beginner anxiety as a freelance writer because you are either good enough to break into the writing world, or you will be good enough after some polishing."
Are you a Depressive Freelancer During a Pandemic?,"Behold the trifecta of doom, right?Please allow me to tell you a little story. I lost five years to chronic depression then spent almost two rebuilding a life word by word, trusting I could write my way out of anything. Because desperation always needs a hint of hubris to function. Mainly, you hope curiosity will override shame and embarrassment.For those five years, I couldn't think so I couldn't write. I sought solace in the words of others so I wouldn't forget my own. I hoped words weren't gone for good, just for the moment.And the moment happened to linger and loiter inconveniently.When I recovered my ability to string words together, I reasoned it was only a matter of time until I processed what had happened and moved on. So when I arrive in the Netherlands at the end of 2019, I'm looking forward to the next chapter of a narrative never not tentative but still ongoing, against all odds.I'm thousands of miles away from the Pacific Northwest, where I started.Better health is almost within my grasp.There are exciting editorial adventures ahead.Soon, I'll stop falling off my bike.Overnight, the pandemic upends everything and life stalls.Lockdown happens.One day, my main challenge is how to re-enter staff employment so I no longer have to rely on freelancing and can eat more than once a day. The next, my main challenge is how to keep freelancing so I can eat at a time when language has become more elusive than ever.I've been here before, this is terrifying.I can't afford to lose my words again as they're vocation, livelihood, and how I deflect rumination. I'm carrying one big omelette in a basket and it's leaking all over my shoes. Still, coaxing my depressive brain into producing or editing copy doesn't give it time for existential angst. And editing other people means spending hours in their universe, an experience that always enriches my own.I second-guess myself far more often than I used to though. This reality is such a curious mix of familiar and off the wall it keeps slipping through my fingers. The brain that spent years trying to kill me makes sure I know it hasn't given up trying.It tells me now is the perfect time to check out.But I'm not done.At this rate, the transition process that was always going to take a while may well take forever. I'm more than OK with that. Although I still think about dying several times a day, it no longer happens daily. This counts as massive progress. ‘Not dead yet' has been my good enough for a long time. Anything on top of that is extra.As many chronically ill folks will tell you, our lives have fallen apart countless times before. However, we're shit show veterans, aren't we? Many of us even freelance despite illness when it isn't exactly the most obvious choice. We're always worse off than employees, on either side of the Atlantic. No sick days, no paid leave, and precariousness as a frequent bonus.But hey, even if we're freelancers by default and not by design, being able to work beats not being able to at all.If the pandemic has already chewed you, you might have failed to consider your greatest strength: ingenuity.Why would your imagination fail you when you've always been able to envision alternatives to what is? There's so much freedom to be found in doing things we've never done before, if only because it shakes up our malfunctioning brains. And it lets our inner child run free, going from no to wow. If your livelihood is disappearing fast, go commit random acts of creative faith and see what sticks. The internet is an ideal sandbox, especially at a time when there's an enormous captive audience.If you can help alleviate the general malaise and disquiet with something you make or do, go for it but maybe steer clear of turning panic into a pay check unless you want it to be your personal brand. It could be quite hard to pivot after that.Many post-pandemic surprises await humanity so you might as well start incubating the future now by embracing enthusiasm wherever you can find it.Remember, this moment is finite.I'm a French-American writer, journalist, and editor living out of a suitcase in transit between North America and Europe. To continue the conversation, follow the bird. For email and everything else, deets in bio."
My Surprising Takeaway From Being an Obsessive Time-Tracker,"As writers, it's easy to feel like there are a zillion demands on our time all the time — and until I get that book deal, the book baby that I spend as much time as possible working on it essentially unpaid labor. To get control over my time and figure out what was actually worth it, I started tracking my time a couple years ago.One of the most important things all the time tracking has taught me is not how much time I spend walking the dogs or writing essays, but how once you start paying attention is really easy to figure out what's worth and what's not worth it — and that threshold is different for each of us.My book baby may be unpaid labor right now, but it's a top priority and I've organized my week around it. I will happily spend as much time on it as I can even though there's no immediate return on investment.Other projects need to earn their weight. One of my minor clients paid me $500 last year for what seemed like odds and ends here and there but turned out to be 17 hours over the course of the year. My hourly rate for them was around $30.Once I did the basic math, it was obvious how I could have earned way more money had I spent that 17 hours working for a client paid me more.I could have bought myself so much time freedom to work on what feels most essential to me rather than netting $500.I dropped the client at the end of last year, and earlier this week I applied the same logic to the creative side of things, when I received a rejection letter that shifted the way I approached submissions.To get a break from a novel I will sometimes work on flash fiction, which is easier to complete a short story and easier to publish in literary magazines. I'll also revise and send out snippets of older things I found on my computer or even scenes from abandoned stories. I'm always sending out a few of these shortform pieces to build publication credits and expose new audiences to my writing.Sending this work out connected me to literary journal that rejected me earlier this week (let's call it Snazzy Litmag). Snazzy Litmag set me back one of those coveted rejection letters that says ""thanks, try us again."" So I did. I got the same letter. I tried again, and I got the same letter with an extra note that this time it was ""really close."" I tried again, and I got an even more fawning rejection letter.And then I decided I was done with Snazzy Litmag!That so-so-so close rejection letter was my $30-per-hour moment. It was the moment when it became abundantly clear to me that the returns of continuing to submit to Snazzy Litmag were diminishing.Like Guy Raz said on his last episode of the TED Radio Hour, I wanted to leave the party while I was still having fun.I didn't want to submit again and get an even more fawning rejection letter. But I also didn't want to submit again and get published. It didn't feel worth my time to write new pieces to submit to a journal that would pay me nothing for publishing them when I could write an essay for an outlet that would pay.Without the clarity of time tracking, I don't think I would have come to this decision. My ego would have clung to the praise and I would have planned a future batch of submissions to Snazzy Litmag, hoping this time the writing was good enough.But I really don't need to be good enough for Snazzy Litmag. That's not my goal. I need to spend my time in ways that feel meaningful to me. I need to do the work that feels most impactful.Right now, that means closing a door so I can give more of my writing time to what's most important to me.Lindsey Danis is a Hudson Valley based writer and frequent traveler who loves telling stories about travel, personal growth, resilience, and LGBTQ communities.

Reinventing Your Career is Possible…And Easy,"Believe me when I say I'd have rathered gouge out my eyes with an acetylene torch than work in the same job the whole of my career. I run fleeing from job descriptions that require fifteen years of me running on a hamster wheel day in and day out. And I know recruiters have majored in missing the point when they look at my background and don't get why I deliberately chose each role, and how the sum of those roles contributed to the work I do today.I would not be as confident and successful if I only knew how to put widget A into box B. I wouldn't have the language to navigate companies with ease if I was myopic, fluent only in the dialect of my department.People always want to put you in a box. Categorize and define you in a way they can understand. But they're simple-minded, unable to think strategically and make the connections to tell the story of you.Here's a fact: I haven't been doing brand marketing since the womb. I started out my career in investment banking and soon hated it because I craved a life where I didn't have to wear pantyhose and run financial models all day. In 1999, I mailed out my paper resume (yes, this was a thing — so was the abacus) to find another job and recruiters told me the only job I could get was one in finance.So, I went on weekend interviews at Merrill Lynch, worked my alumni connections to break into Berkshire Hathaway, and I would cry in the lobby because the selling point of each bank was the convenience of having showers in the building.SURELY, YOU JEST.Frustrated, I decided to manufacture experience where I had none. I built an e-commerce site where I sold designer clothing and accessories that I'd purchased from outlets and sample sales in New York. Back then, you didn't have The RealReal or Nordstrom Rack online, and there was a demand for designer clothing on the cheap for people who didn't have access.I completed the LLC paperwork, did my own books, put in an application to be a payment processor so I can accept credit cards, designed and built a website, bought the clothes based on trends I'd analyze in magazines, TV shows and what I'd see on the streets, wrote sales copy, used my status as an eBay power seller to market my website, and managed all the shipping and customer service in an apartment over a barn out in Long Island. I even got my pop into the act and a man who broke and exercised thoroughbred horses soon became fluent in Prada and Dolce & Gabanna.You should know except for the writing part, I'm horrible at everything I've just described. I've no head for visuals. Up until last year, I couldn't balance my checking account. But I did it because I've learned that if you want something and people keep denying you that something, there's nothing you won't do to get that something. If you're hungry enough. Tenacious enough. And realize that done is better than perfect.My work caught the attention of the burgeoning Oxygen network and a woman came out to the horse farm in which my pop worked and we lived and interviewed the scrappy duo selling Badgley Mischka gowns online. That interview caught the attention of my future boss, who would hire me to be a project manager for a luxury dot.com that would soon be sold to LVMH.Fuck finance. A new career was born. And I've been making lateral and upward moves ever since. Because I viewed my career as a set of tools in a toolkit. If there was something I wanted to learn, I would take a job or build a side hustle in that something. I took a job in marketing and business development at Time Warner because I wanted traditional consumer marketing experience. I shifted to book publishing because I was intrigued by the intersection of commerce and art and how to understand customers to market books to them.I had side hustles where I published an online & print literary journal from 2002 to 2007 because I was intrigued by bringing content online and understanding the entire editorial, publishing, and marketing process surrounding words. I was an equity partner in a small social/digital agency in New York because I wanted to get my hands dirty and work with a slew of brands across industries and categories so I could be nimble enough to work in any company, fast. I worked at a global agency as a VP Strategy to understand bigger brands, bigger budgets, and more sophisticated ways of learning about customers and using data and insights to build brands and tell stories.All of these roles (either taken or designed by me) were in pursuit of following what made me curious. And the confluence of understanding customers, products, and businesses and my background as a novelist found me merging the two seemingly disparate worlds of marketing and storytelling to captivate, capture and convert customers.I didn't know in 2014 I would start building brands for clients, but all of the work I was attracted to gave me a full spectrum of experience that not only informed the work that lights me up today but didn't trap me too much in the discipline so I was unable to critique it and design a process rooted in discipline and reality.Last week, I was coaching a client who has a decades-long career in CPG (consumer packaged goods) marketing and sales. Anyone familiar with CPG knows that this particular category has a lexicon and a type of marketing specific to the category. I won't torture you with the details, but my client wanted to make a leap to help businesses be better citizens. But she didn't know what a consulting practice could look like because it wasn't something she'd ever done before.So, I asked her to do three things:Then, I asked her to review all the exercises and write the story about a day or week or future project she'd be working on in two year's time. Whether it was designing a business model that centered on impact, or designing marketing strategies and campaigns that connected cause and product, or created a mission-driven culture internally in an organization — the thread line was she didn't want to work with companies that were garbage humans, putting profit over people.Do this for yourself. Once you have a working idea of what you want to do, define what your new role entails.This is the moment when you need to be a CIA operative. You have to show up and do the work. This isn't a time to be lazy, friends. Research your desired role and what it entails by:The objective here is to understand what would be required of your new role and the gaps you need to fill.Inventory your career against your dream role. Even if the job descriptions don't match, get creative. When you're inventorying your career, bullet out all of the things you had to do on a daily basis (hard and soft skills), the technology you used, other departments or resources you were directly exposed to. The idea is to pull relevant experience and expertise (even if it isn't directly correlated) that will help in your new role.I firmly believe most people aren't stupid, and given the chance, they can bootstrap their pivot or dream role if they're hungry enough and ego-free.For example, I worked in marketing in book publishing (a non-fiction imprint at HarperCollins) and I'm also an author and writer. Both experiences inform my work in brand strategy and content development because:Pull the related experience that makes sense for your new dream career.Now, there will be aspects of your new role that are foreign to you. Back in 2013, one of my closest friends was a traditional brand strategist and marketer — MBA from Stern, a dozen years of experience doing what I wanted to do. But she lacked digital and social acumen and expertise, and she knew she needed that to stay competitive.So, we decided on an informal cross-mentorship. We would shadow each other's projects (for free because we were learning but also providing assistance — think of it as bartering that's mutually beneficial) to learn terminology, process, format, and methodology. We'd work together to build a brand platform and a digital marketing strategy. We did this for about a year on our respective projects. It wasn't a huge leap for me to learn my gaps because I already had a career in marketing.Consider it a fast-tracked MBA, but in real life without the fuckton of student loans.Maybe there's someone in your network where you can partner up for a time to shadow one another on real projects.Or you can take online courses, do pro-bono work (and being transparent with your client that you're learning as you go), offer to intern or shadow someone you admire (or a peer) to help them on a project while gaining real expertise and mentorship.There are so many ways you can fill the gaps and gain experience for your dream job as long as you show up and do the work.Don't think you have to be deadbolted to your current job because it's familiar, safe. If I manage to crawl out of working three years in finance to shift to a career in marketing while the internet was still a shiny object, you can do it now with the plethora of easily-accessible resources.So, if you're forced to find a new role or want to seize the opportunity to drop-kick your current job in favor of something other, know you can do it if you're hungry, curious, agile, smart, and willing to do the work."
The Leadership Attributes Associated with Successful Leaders,"After a decade of studying leadership theories, attributes associated with individual leaders, the following traits and skills tend to be consistent across each study:The article will explore the validity of traits as a predictor for success.Specific personality traits commonly discussed in research studies cover the following:Considered to include related themes such as self-esteem and self-efficacy. Leaders with higher levels of self-confidence are:Trait research shows that energy levels, physical stamina, and stress tolerance are associated with effectiveness. They are relevant in situations such as:Someone with a high need for power enjoys influencing people and events. They are more likely to seek positions of authority, pointing to a strong relationship between the need for power and career advancement.Need for power is categories as socialized power and personalized power with the following characteristics:Narcissism is a personality syndrome with several traits associated with effective leadership such as a strong need for esteem, attention, and status.The characteristics of these leaders are:There are some benefits where leaders with these attributes will mobilize and lead bold projects and strongly deal with severe threats.The term emotional maturity encompasses a number of motives and values. Characteristics of an emotionally mature person include:Research shows that emotional maturity is linked to managerial effectiveness and advancement.People with a strong locus of control orientation believe they can control situations and outcomes through action. People with a low orientation believe events are random, by chance or fate and their actions have little or no effect.Research shows a correlation with ‘Internal' and managerial effectiveness, with the following characteristicsResearch also shows there is a stronger relationship to the effectiveness of dynamic firms where the requirement for product innovation is high.Integrity in the context of business behavior is in line with espoused values, that a person is honest, ethical, and trustworthy. Characteristics of high integrity in leaders include:Low integrity is linked to career derailment while high Integrity linked to growth and advancementAchievement orientation is grounded in personal needs. There is some debate as to its impact on effectiveness, but most studies do find a link between high achievement orientation and effectiveness.Those with high achievement orientations more likely to:Effectiveness linked to power orientation, achievement orientation is more effective if grounded in socialized power orientation.That said, it may be destructive, counterproductive if driven by personalized power orientation.People with a high need for affiliation feel great satisfaction from being liked and accepted.There is a low correlation between a high need for affiliation and managerial effectiveness. People with a high need for affiliation tend to:Low need for affiliation:Too low a need for affiliation can be negative as it can cause individuals to fail to develop interpersonal skills.There is some debate on the link of attributes with the Big 5 Personality traits, mostly confused by terms, taxonomies, so more research is required.Three skillful areas required for effective leaders are:№1 ~ Technical Skills — Important at lower-level management, whereby knowledge of organization technologies, methods, structures, and processes is more relevant.Technical skills are also important for the supervision of subordinates and knowledge of competitor's products.Technical skills are common in entrepreneurial managers and their competencies can feed innovation initiatives.Technical skills can change over a manager's career.№2 ~ Interpersonal Skills — This is knowledge of human behavior, group processes and the ability to interpret the feelings and motivation of others.Specific aptitudes Include:These skills can:№3 ~ Conceptual Skills — These consist of:Refined cognitive agility enables those with such skills to see patterns and inter-relationships in complex working environments.The phrase ""Charming but not brilliant"" relates to managers with strong technical and interpersonal skills but a lack of conceptual skills.Such competencies are considered to be a combination of skills, behaviors, and traits. They include:№1 ~ Emotional Intelligence — Includes soft-skills like:Emotional Intelligence is relevant in the following areas:There is some controversy on emotional intelligence with critics claiming that it simply bundles known traits and skills, adding no new insights on effective leadership.№2 ~ Social Intelligence — Is the ability to determine the right leadership approach in a certain situation by selecting the appropriate response.A core ability here is social perception — the awareness to understand the needs, challenges, and opportunities facing an individual or group.№3 ~ Learning Ability — Lifelong learning is woven into the modern business world, requiring leaders who can:Relevant traits are:Leaders with these traits tend to be:Leaders need many skills but specific skill selection is situation-dependent, such as:As touched on above, the requirement for technical skills can change over a manager's career.Technical skills are the highest importance at the beginning of the career followed by interpersonal skills and then conceptual skills.As a manager progresses into leadership the importance of skills inverts — conceptual skills and interpersonal skills becomes more important than technical skills.An interesting question about leadership skills is how transferable they are.There is a general agreement in research that they are not transferable to other functions or organizations at a lower level. With less agreement and more debate at higher levels with the following considerations:Theories suggest that the skills required are relevant to the environment and status of the organization. Some examples include:Premium skills identified in research for dealing with these situations include:There's a lot of ‘dense' material on this topic with cross-reference between terms and interpretations commonplace.Research is hindered by methodology and some conceptual weaknesses:Research repeats a lot too, which is perhaps indicative of the variation and complexity associated with trait theory.That said, to distill a few simple takeaways, my recommendations for managers and future leaders are:If you're hungry for more, there's a selection of articles in the piece below:"
Why We Need Experts,"In a 2015 poll, 30% of Republicans and 19% of Democrats supported bombing Agrabah, the fictional hometown of the Disney character Aladdin. In a similar vein, a 2014 poll found that the less people knew about where Ukraine is located on a map, the more they wanted the U.S. to intervene militarily.To make matters worse, another study done by researchers at Ohio State University found that when confronted with scientific evidence that conflicted with their pre-existing views, such as the reality of climate change or the safety of vaccines, partisans would not only reject the evidence, but become hostile and question the objectivity of science.It's become fashionable in certain circles to dismiss experts. Yet as the Coronavirus crisis has shown us, we ignore expertise at our peril. The reason we need professionals with specialized knowledge, however, isn't so that we can outsource our decisions to them. Rather, we need experts to help us ask better questions, explore options and to make better judgments.It's no secret that our world is becoming increasingly complex. So it shouldn't be surprising that many harken for a simpler existence in which we can rely on parochial observations and good old-fashioned common sense. Complexity makes us feel powerless, because it creates a world that is difficult to understand, while simplicity makes us feel more in control.Yet in Overcomplicated, mathematician Sam Arbesman gives two reasons why complexity is, to a great extent, unavoidable. The first is accretion. We build systems, like the Internet or the laws set down in the US Constitiution, to perform a limited number of tasks. Yet to scale those systems, we need to build on top of them to expand their initial capabilities. As systems become larger, they get more complex.The second force that leads to complexity is interaction. We may love the simplicity of our iPhones, but don't want to be restricted to its capabilities alone. So we increase its functionality by connecting it to millions of apps. Those apps, in turn, connect to each other as well as to other systems. Every connection increases complexity.The simple fact is that to operate in an environment of increasing complexity, we not only need experts, but increased specialization of expertise. To point to just one example, TopTal, an expert freelance service, offers dozens of specialties ranging from mixed reality developers and UX designers to blockchain consultants and Agile coaches.Expertise is no panacea. In fact, in a twenty year study of political experts, Philip Tetlock found that that expert predictions were no better than flipping a coin. Further, he found that pundits who specialized in a particular field tended to perform worse than those whose knowledge was more general.He called this phenomenon ""the hedgehog and the fox"" after the famous essay by Isaiah Berlin, in which a fox knows many things, but a hedgehog knows one important thing extremely well. Foxes are generalists, while hedgehogs are specialists. What Tetlock found was that, in the contest between them, the fox nearly always wins.This is so counterintuitive that it hardly seems possible, but it's true. The reason lies in the confidence of the predictions. Specialists, with their deep knowledge of a particular subject, tend not to incorporate information outside their domain, which makes for a cleaner, more definitive story line. They see things as simpler and are more sure of themselves.A hedgehog claims unique insight. A fox does no such thing. So foxes, with their broad-based knowledge, are more conscious of complexity and less confident, but more accurate. Complexity makes us more careful. It makes us look for more information and forces us to check our facts. If we see things as simple and clear, we tend to feel less need to do those things.Thomas Kuhn explained in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions that, at some point expertise runs its course. As the world changes and evolves, flaws in existing models become more and more evident, eventually becoming untenable. That's what sets the stage for a paradigm shift. ""Failure of existing rules is the prelude to a search for new ones,"" he wrote.Yet new paradigms almost always need to be championed by outsiders or newcomers rather than acknowledged experts. Or, as the physicist Max Planck put it ""a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.""In my book Mapping Innovation, I showed how data and real-world experience bear this out. On the innovation platform Innocentive, problems tend not to be solved within the domain in which they arose, but by a practitioner in an adjacent field. For example, when a problem has the chemistry world stuck, it's usually someone like a biologist or a physicist that solves it.Yet even in the context of breakthroughs, experts have a role to play. Researchers at Northwestern University analyzed nearly 18 million scientific papers and found that the most highly cited work most often comes from a highly focused team of specialized experts working with an outsider. That combination of deep domain expertise and outside thinking is often what produces major breakthroughs.We all like to have opinions. If we are asked whether we should bomb Agrabah or send the Marines into Eastern Ukraine, we want to have our voice heard. Yet our desire to make judgments has nothing to do with our ability to make wise choices. In fact, studies have shown that confidence in our judgments is inversely correlated to their accuracy.So the function of experts is not to make us more sure of our judgments, but less so. Ask a group of experts about any significant topic in their field and you are likely to get a wide range of opinions, which can be maddening. After all, if the experts can't agree on a clear answer, then what's the point of specialized knowledge?Yet the purpose of expertise isn't to make things simpler for us, but to give us better information. Any expert in foreign policy can tell us that Agrabah does not, in fact, exist, just as subject matter experts can explain the complicated history of Russian-Ukrainian relations or how Coronavirus is transmitted and what it will take to develop a vaccine.That's why we need experts. Not to give us answers, but to help us ask better questions. That's how we can, as Kuhn put it, find the flaws in existing rules so that we can search for new ones. It's how we, as non-experts, can help those who are look in different places, consider the evidence in a new light and, hopefully, develop a more effective paradigm.Greg Satell is an international keynote speaker, adviser and bestselling author of Cascades: How to Create a Movement that Drives Transformational Change.

"How Organizational Burnout Led to the 1986 Challenger Disaster, and What Engineering Teams Can Learn from It — ProdPerfect","Imagine the morning of January 28, 1986. You are sitting in mission control, tensely and helplessly watching as the Challenger space shuttle begins its lift-off from Florida's Kennedy Space Center. Just 73 seconds after takeoff, at an altitude of about 46,000 feet, the shuttle is engulfed in a cloud of fire. You watch in terror as the orbiter is torn apart, falling out of the sky into the Atlantic Ocean below, killing all seven astronauts on board.The Moment of Launch: Software and SpaceSpace is inherently dangerous. Space travel operates at every known extreme of human engineering and endurance. Software development is far tamer, and the rules are gentler by the same degree. In launching a shuttle, a team only has one shot (and though stakes were lower, the same was true of software launches before advanced web development). In deploying a web application, a team now has opportunities for continuous improvement, even after launch.The pressure on web software is far lower, but the nature of the operation has real parallels. NASA is an engineering organization first, with a mission. Like NASA, great software organizations have a mission, and humans who work passionately to realize it. Like mission control supporting the Challenger and every other shuttle launch, all of that engineering effort and quality testing culminates in the moment of launch: when we set our products into the world to face all the forces of chaos-users, networks, and cyber attacks-therein.Software failures tend to be far less dramatic than the disintegration of the Challenger, but Dan (my CEO) and I are acutely aware of the tremendous impact software engineering has on the well-being of mankind. The stakes tend not to be as immediately grave as with the launch of a space shuttle, but a software team's success or failure-and the trend towards success or failure in the industry-have real impact on the lives of billions of people: their health, their jobs, their safety, their mobility, their happiness. As software continues to "" eat the world ,"" the stakes keep going up.The tragedy of the Challenger compels us to bear the weight of our own duty as engineers to society at large: to beware the road towards the organizational breakdown that allowed the crew of the Challenger to be lost and the breakdowns that cause world-changing products to end up in the dust bin. Here, we examine how NASA failed in its mission to safely launch humans into space, how organizational burnout led to the 1986 Challenger disaster, and where engineering organizations today can find these signs of burnout before they lead to disaster.Organizational Burnout: What Went WrongIn the wake of the Challenger disaster, investigations found that the shuttle launch failed due to a faulty o-ring: an elastomer loop designed to seal joints between sections of the rocket booster to prevent leaks from the fuel tank. Cold temperatures that morning made the o-ring brittle and caused it to fail under high pressures during liftoff. Hot gas, escaping through the leak in the o-ring, pierced the fuel tank and ignited it.Later, findings from the Rogers Commission revealed that this tragedy could have been prevented: multiple failures of organizational checks led this critical flaw to not only remain in the shuttle, but to be unmitigated by procedure. Many NASA engineers and managers had been aware since 1977 (nine years before Challenger) that the o-rings had a potentially catastrophic flaw. Despite the concerns of frontline engineers who predicted a "" catastrophe of the highest order "" and requested to delay the launch, management at both NASA and its contractor decided to move forward. The Rogers Commission concluded that the Challenger failure was rooted in a deeper cultural failure within NASA, plagued by flawed decision-making , faulty communication, and a lack of internal checks and balances.In short: plenty of people knew about this problem and either chose to do nothing about it, or were rebuffed by the organization's inertia when they tried. Return to that chilly morning of January 28th in mission control. Imagine that you were one of the engineers who pled for a delay or one of the managers that, through incentives and external pressure, chose to launch anyway. Before you keep reading, think about whether you've ever been in a similar situation in your own organization.Organizational burnout occurs as a result of upstream failures to inspire employee motivation and flourishing in the workplace. This includes implementing processes that uphold individual and collective greatness, purpose, reward, and problem solving through upholding values such as enthusiasm, impact, ownership, transparency, and humility. Flourishing organizations are nimble and reactive; burnt-out organizations operate largely by inertia alone. It is clear in retrospect that by the mid 1980s, NASA had begun to suffer from organizational burnout. Laconic and inefficient forces drove leaders to lose sight of the mission to safely deploy humans into space, as well as fail to reinforce values that supported this mission.Valuing Greatness: EnthusiasmNASA's organizational burnout is such a powerful story because as an organization it saw both extremes of this spectrum between burnout and flourishing. The NASA of the Apollo program (1961–1975) stands in stark contrast to the NASA that allowed Challenger to launch with a faulty o-ring. What made this program truly great was not how well its participants were paid nor how intelligent they were, but how much they believed in the program itself. You did not need to beat market salaries to bring people into the Apollo program. National enthusiasm for space was at an all-time high. John F. Kennedy's 1862 moonshot speech reflected this sentiment: "" We choose to go to the moon in this decade…because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win ."" This moon landing was the single most inspiring, world-uniting event in human history. In this form of NASA, people who worked at every level of the organization were intrinsically and extrinsically motivated to succeed in their mission. Concerns from front-line engineers were carefully evaluated and responded to; problems were solved through rapid iteration, testing, failure, and learning before launch. In this organization, failure was not an option, so they did not fail.At the time of NASA's Challenger, the U.S. had already won the space race to the moon. Americans' enthusiasm for manned space flights had waned, and there was a drastic decline in public awe and wonder about space. The shuttle program could no longer inspire the same enthusiasm from national leaders and had largely stopped innovating. This created a feedback loop in which the program received less funding and fewer recruits who shared an enthusiasm for the US's mission in space. NASA was under pressure to keep its budget low and its operations highly predictable. Delays were frowned upon, and cost overruns were scrutinized more than safety and mission success. The values that had made NASA great had faded.Valuing Purpose: ImpactA lack of clear mission alignment in burnt out organizations leads to a decreased sense of individuals' potential for impact. You may know organizations in which it seems people care less about maximizing their impact and more about survival: simply collecting a paycheck. When employees don't believe the organizational mission is worthy of their effort, creative energy, and personal risk, they no longer go out of their way to fight for their impact on the mission. We can imagine that if someone were sufficiently convicted about the mission of the Challenger , they would have been willing to risk their career and even circumvent management in order to share their concerns and ensure the safety of their colleagues.Valuing Reward: OwnershipYou may know the classic experiment of the rat in a maze with cheese: after repeatedly navigating the maze, the rat learns that the cheese lies on the same path and seeks it repeatedly. When it's clear that alternative paths offer no reward (or provide punishment), the mammal brain sticks to what works. When our organizations reinforce that there is only one path to reward, we will respond in the same way. In burnt out organizations, leaders often fail to create a cycle of accountability and reward with employees, neither negatively reinforcing silence nor positively reinforcing raising voices. At NASA, this lack of ownership led even those with life-saving insight to eventually settle into the trodden path of keeping their heads down, doing their job, and not making too much fuss. This is where over-reliance on policy stifles ownership: the stricter a policy is built, the less room remains for individual initiative.Valuing Problem-Solving: Transparency and HumilityNASA's failure in the Challenger mission also reflected a failure in the organization's transparency about its challenges and financial needs with the public. This was in part because by the 1980s, the lack of clarity in NASA's overall mission meant that public support for funding had dropped, and NASA had to keep its head down. The idea of space travel had simply become blasé. During the Apollo era, the mission was evident to both the organization and U.S. taxpayers. Whereas almost 100% of Americans watched the Apollo launch live, only 15% witnessed the Challenger disaster. This lack of national enthusiasm discouraged NASA from sharing any bad news with Congress for fear of being attacked by budget hawks as being bad stewards of taxpayer dollars.Not only did NASA leadership fail in communicating issues with the public, they failed to demonstrate the humility to receive internal feedback from the front lines of their own organization. They had little incentive to go out of their way to create processes and devote resources to prioritizing internal concerns. Instead of building direct lines of feedback between those with on-the-ground insight and decision-makers at the top, they allowed bureaucratic practices to create major roadblocks to transparency. Those roadblocks, built unintentionally over time, were effective in keeping bad news from causing a ruckus in Congress, but they also kept real crises from being elevated and prioritized.What's Next?: Software Organizations TodayThe symptoms of burnout we saw in NASA in the 1980s are likely very familiar to most of our readers here. Organizations burn out slowly, over time, for similar reasons: the human spirit that first inspired an organization's moonshot wanes when the mission becomes fuzzy, when failure becomes acceptable, and when pressure to become ""lean"" and predictable outweighs the spark to innovate and iterate.Though all engineering organizations are vulnerable to burnout, we are not doomed to it. Some leaders excel at refreshing and reinforcing inspirational missions and values among their people. They challenge and reward employees for caring about the mission, mitigating risks that prevent companies from delivering value to customers and upholding product quality through launch. These leaders create systems of accountability and reward that drive this mission forward at every level, so that when people see something that risks quality, they take action. They inspire enthusiasm and reward transparency when problems arise. Unlike NASA, they paint a picture of a clear, new, seemingly impossible target after the once-incredible moonshot has become mundane.From Organizational Burnout to Organizational ExcellenceGreat engineering leaders rely on data to tell them where to iterate, where to innovate, where to delay launch, where to fix problems. Great software teams use test automation, application performance monitoring, canary builds, user feedback, and many other signals to tell them where to find risks and opportunities. They constantly proceduralize and celebrate the actions that respond effectively to those signals. Maintaining a culture of excellence requires constant effort. Burnout is like entropy, and it wins out in time if new energy is not brought into a system.If you are on the front lines of a profoundly burnt out organization, perhaps you have tried and failed to make sustainable change. Remember that it doesn't have to be this way, and that you may simply need to change organizations. If you are on the front lines of an organization that is starting to show signs of burnout, consider having a serious conversation with the highest-level leader you have access to. Help them understand the systemic risks they're introducing by abiding by the status quo. Show them this article.Regardless of the state of your organization, if you are a leader, you are responsible for taking action. Get started by reading resources on organizational change including Leading Change, by John P. Cotter and Turn the Ship Around! by David Marquet. Finally, remember that transforming burnout into excellence is a tremendously difficult and lengthy journey. You must decide whether you care enough about the mission and its turnaround to do the work of creating processes that reward what is right and correct what is wrong.Instilling an organization with strong values and reinforcing them through effective processes transforms individuals at all levels. It inspires employees to explore alternatives and surface concerns on the frontline. And it inspires leadership to prioritize sensitive response and forward-thinking change. Of course, we will make mistakes. But we can commit to remaining teachable, sharing responsibility, and caring for the mission we are building towards together.Originally published at https://prodperfect.com on March 11, 2020."
